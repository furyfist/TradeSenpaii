NOTE B - SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Unit sales of soft drink and noncarbonated beverage products are generally greater in the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. Total comprehensive income for the second quarter 1999 was $921 million, compared to $1,064 million in the second quarter of 1998. For the first six months of 1999, total comprehensive income was $1,206 million, primarily reflecting a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $520 million. Total comprehensive income was $1,949 million for the first six NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE D - ISSUANCES OF STOCK BY EQUITY INVESTEES When one of our equity investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee decreases. In the event the issuance price per share is more or less than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance. This noncash gain or loss, net of any deferred taxes, is generally recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs.

This type of transaction is reflected as an equity transaction and the net effect is reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the first quarter of 1999, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) completed its acquisition of various bottlers. These transactions were funded primarily with shares of CCE common stock. The CCE common stock issued was valued in an amount greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. As a result of these transactions, our equity in the underlying net assets of CCE increased, and we recorded a $241 million increase to our Company's investment basis in CCE. Due to CCE's share repurchase programs, the increase in our investment in CCE was recorded as an equity transaction and no gain was recognized. We recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $95 million on this increase to our investment in CCE. The transactions reduced our ownership in CCE from approximately 42 percent to approximately 40 percent. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE D - ISSUANCES OF STOCK BY EQUITY INVESTEES (Continued) In June 1998, CCE completed its acquisition of CCBG Corporation and Texas Bottling Group, Inc.

NOTE B - SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Unit sales of soft drink and noncarbonated beverage products are generally greater in the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. Total comprehensive income for the third quarter 1999 was $763 million, compared to $759 million in the third quarter of 1998. For the first nine months of 1999, total comprehensive income was $1,969 million, primarily reflecting a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $525 million. Total comprehensive income was $2,708 million for the first nine months of 1998.

In the event the issuance price per share is more or less than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance. This noncash gain or loss, net of any deferred taxes, is generally recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs. In the third quarter of 1998, Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke AG (CCEAG), a bottler in Germany, issued new shares valued at approximately $275 million to effect a merger with Nordwest Getranke GmbH & Co. KG, another German bottler. Approximately 7.5 million shares were issued, resulting in a one-time noncash pretax gain for our Company of approximately $27 million. We provided deferred taxes of approximately $10 million on this gain. This issuance reduced our ownership in CCEAG from approximately 45 percent to approximately 40 percent. If gains have been previously recognized on issuances of an equity investee's stock and shares of the equity investee are subsequently repurchased by the equity investee, gain recognition does not occur on issuances subsequent to the date of a repurchase until shares have been issued in an amount equivalent to the number of repurchased shares.

The CCE common stock issued was valued in an amount greater than the book value per share of our investment in CCE. As a result of these transactions, our equity in the underlying net assets of CCE increased, and we recorded a $241 million increase to our Company's investment basis in CCE. Due to CCE's share repurchase programs, the increase in our investment in CCE was recorded as an equity transaction and no gain was recognized.

They do not include all information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of The Coca-Cola Company (our Company) for the year ended December 31, 1999. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2000, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2000. Certain amounts in our prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. NOTE B - SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Unit sales of soft drink and noncarbonated beverage products are generally greater in the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. NOTE C - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) For the first three months of 2000, total comprehensive loss was $205 million, primarily reflecting a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $108 million and a net decrease in the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of approximately $39 million. Total comprehensive income was $285 million for the first three months of 1999, primarily reflecting a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $476 million. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our effective tax rate was 160 percent for the first quarter of 2000 compared to 31 percent for the first quarter of 1999. The change in our effective tax rate in 2000 was primarily the result of our current inability to realize a tax benefit on the $405 million impairment charges, as discussed in ""Note G - Other Operating Charges"". Excluding the impact of these impairment charges, the effective tax rate on operations was 31 percent for the first quarter of 2000 which reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. During the first quarter of 2000, the United States and Japanese taxing authorities entered into an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) whereby the level of royalties paid by the Coca-Cola (Japan) Company, Ltd. (our Subsidiary) to our Company has been established for the years 1993 through 2001. Pursuant to the terms of the APA, our Subsidiary has filed amended returns for the applicable periods reflecting the negotiated royalty rate.

NOTE B - SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Unit sales of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage products are generally greater in the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. Total comprehensive income for the second quarter 2000 was $636 million, due primarily to a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $270 million and a net decrease in the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of approximately $20 million.

Certain amounts in our prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. NOTE B - SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS Unit sales of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage products are generally greater in the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. Total comprehensive income for the third quarter 2000 was $973 million, comprising Net Income of $1,067 million, an increase in the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of approximately $3 million, offset by a net reduction for foreign currency translation of approximately $97 million.

The reduction in our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2000 compared with the third quarter of 1999 was due primarily to the recognition of a tax free gain of approximately $118 million upon the merger of Coca-Cola Beverages plc and Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. This transaction is discussed further in ""Note H - Other Income - Net"". The effective tax rate was 33.8 percent for the first nine months of 2000 compared to 31.0 percent for the first nine months of 1999. The change in our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2000 compared with the first nine months of 1999 was primarily the result of our current inability to realize a tax benefit on the $405 million impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2000 as discussed further in ""Note G - Other Operating Charges"", partially offset by the tax free gain of $118 million referred to above.

Note B — Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (""Interpretation 46""), ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities."" Application of this interpretation was required in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 for interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special-purpose entities. Our Company determined that we do not have any arrangements or relationships with special-purpose entities. Application of Interpretation 46 for all other types of variable interest entities was required for our Company effective March 31, 2004. 46 addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition (ownership of a majority voting interest) of consolidation does not apply. This interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. It concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests, a company's exposure (variable interest) to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity's assets and activities are the best evidence of control. If an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity, it would be considered the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary is generally required to include assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. our financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and prior to December 31, 2003, we consolidated all entities that we controlled by ownership of a majority of voting interests. As a result of Interpretation 46, our balance sheet as of March 31, 2004 included the assets and liabilities of: entities in which The Coca-Cola Company or its subsidiaries have ownership of a majority of voting interests; and additionally, variable interest e"

However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of The Coca-Cola Company for the year ended December 31, 2004. When used in these notes, the terms ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" or ""our"" mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2005. amounts in our prior period consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. to Note B for a discussion of variable interest entities. Note B — Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"" (""Interpretation 46"" or ""FIN 46""). Application of this interpretation was required in consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 for interests in variable interest entities that were considered to be special-purpose entities. Our Company determined that we did not have any arrangements or relationships with special-purpose entities. Application of Interpretation 46 for all other types of variable interest entities was required for our Company effective March 31, 2004. 46 addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition (ownership of a majority voting interest) of consolidation does not apply. This interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. It concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests, a company's exposure (variable interest) to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity's assets and activities are the best evidence of control. If an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity, it would be considered the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary is generally required to include assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. our financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and prior to December 31, 2003, we consolidated all entities that we controlled by ownership of a majority of voting interests. As a result of Interpretation 46, effective as of March 31, 2004, our consolidated balance sheet includes the assets and liabilities of: entities in which the Company has ownership of a majority of voting interests; and additionally, var"

Previously, the vesting of options held at least 12 months accelerated at age 55 and 10 years of service or age 60 and one (1) year of service. Under the plans as amended, the vesting of options held at least 12 months accelerates at age 60 with 10 years of service.

As a result, the time period that an option may be exercised in the event of death under the 1999 Stock Option Plan has been changed from the earlier of 12 months from the date of death and the expiration date of the option to the earlier of five (5) years from the date of death and the expiration date of the option.

These amendments include a mandatory and an optional provision. The mandatory provision provides that an optionee who is subject to the Company’s stock ownership guidelines may not sell net shares (i.e. shares remaining after payment of the exercise price and/or taxes) of Company common stock obtained upon exercise of an option award until the optionee has satisfied the applicable stock ownership guidelines, and then may sell only the number of such shares in excess of those guidelines. The optional provision, which may be used in a stock option award agreement at the Compensation Committee’s discretion, provides that the optionee may not sell any of the net shares of Company common stock obtained upon exercise of an option award until after the optionee ceases to be employed by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in the amendments to these equity compensation plans were approved by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the authority granted to the Compensation Committee under the terms of each of the respective plans.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. Due to the necessity of protecting the Company’s confidential business plans from competitors, on February 19, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) decided to revise the criteria on which it would base its determination to pay annual incentive awards to the Company’s named executive officers (as defined in Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”)) for fiscal year 2008 under the Performance Incentive Plan of The Coca-Cola Company (the “Plan”). The Company previously announced that awards for 2008 would be determined based upon (i) the business performance criteria set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on February 21, 2008 and (ii) the 2007 annual incentive formula set forth in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Commission on March 3, 2008 (the “2008 Proxy Statement”). Under that formula, the annual incentive for the Company’s named executive officers would have been calculated as follows: Base Salary X Annual Incentive Target % X Business Performance Factor % X Personal Performance Factor % (the “Formula”). The approved business performance measures under the Plan for 2008 were net income and volume (for those with corporate responsibilities) and profit before taxes and volume (for those with operating unit responsibilities). Compensation Committee decided not to base its determination of awards to the named executive officers on the Formula, and determined instead to award bonuses on a discretionary basis. The Compensation Committee decided not to use the Formula in response to the position of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Commission that, if the Compensation Committee were to use the Formula, the Company would be required to publicly disclose the specific volume, net income and pre-tax profit targets that would result in payments under the Plan. These targets are derived from the Company’s confidential business plan, and the Company believes that disclosure of the targets would enable competitors to determine the Company’s business plan and pricing strategy and adjust their own business plans and strategies accordingly. Rather than subject the Company to the substantial competitive harm that would result from the disclosure of the targets comprising the business performance factor, the Compensation Committee decided to award bonuses on an entirely discretionary basis, without utilizing the Formula and the matrix described in the 2008 Proxy Statement. In utilizing its discretion, the Compensation Committee considered a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, volume growth, earnings per share growth, global volume and value share gains and overall Company operating performance in the current economic climate in order to make its authorizes the Compensation Committee to make discretionary awards to executive officers of the Company based on a percentage of the participant’s salary, subject to the dollar limitations set forth in the Plan. The 2008 by the Compensation Committee to the named executive officers will be made in accordance with these provisions of the Plan. Compensation Committee’s decision to award discretionary bonuses to the named executive officers means that the bonuses awarded to the U.S. based named executive officers of the Company other than the Chief Financial Officer will not be deductible for tax purposes pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. reaching its decision, the Compensation Committee weighed the additional tax cost versus the competitive harm in disclosing the Plan targets and determined that the potential competitive harm significantly outweighed the additional tax cost, which is not material. The Compensation Committee believes that this decision is in the best interests of the Company and its to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto"

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. As previously reported, on February 25, 2010, The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation (“TCCC”), Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CCE”), International CCE, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE (“New CCE”), and Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCCC (“Merger Sub”), entered into a Business Separation and Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which TCCC will acquire all of the North American business of CCE (the “Merger”). On February 25, 2010, March 8, 2010 and March 10, 2010, three putative shareholder class action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia on behalf of all shareholders of CCE (other than defendants) challenging the proposed Merger. The action is captioned In re The Coca-Cola Shareholders Litigation (C.A. No. 2010-cv-182035) (the “Georgia Action”). The complaint alleges that by virtue of TCCC’s stock ownership and business dealings with CCE, TCCC controls and dominates CCE and therefore owes CCE a duty of entire fairness and a duty not to misuse its control of CCE for its own ends, which TCCC breached because, among other things, the proposed Merger is unfair as to price and process. Plaintiffs further allege that the CCE directors have violated their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, candor and good faith by pursuing the proposed Merger, which is not entirely fair to CCE shareholders because, among other things, the May 25, 2010 Form S-4 Registration Statement filed by New CCE with the SEC fails to provide shareholders with the material information relevant to determine the fairness of the proposed Merger and evidences the CCE directors’ failure to appropriately consider the proposed Merger. In addition, on March 1, 2010, March 3, 2010, March 8, 2010 and March 10, 2010, five putative shareholder class action complaints were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on behalf of all shareholders of CCE (other than defendants) challenging the proposed Merger. The consolidated action is captioned In re Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Shareholders Litigation (Consolidated C.A. No. 5291- VCN) (the “Delaware Action”). The complaint alleges that the proposed Merger arises out of an unlawful plan and scheme for TCCC to acquire CCE’s entire North American bottlin g business for grossly inadequate consideration and in breach of defendants’ fiduciary duties. On September 3, 2010, the parties to the Georgia Action executed a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) containing the terms for the parties’ agreement in principle to resolve the Georgia Action. The MOU provides, among other things, that, in consideration for the settlement of the Georgia Action, the Merger Agreement will be amended to reflect that (i) the Termination Fee, as defined in Section 8.2(c) of the Merger Agreement is reduced from $200,000,000 to $180,000,000, (ii) Section 8.2(d)(D) of the Merger Agreement is modified such that the 365 calendar day period following the termination of the Merger Agreement referred to in that paragraph is reduced to nine (9) months following the termination of the Merger Agreement, (iii) Section 6.22 of the Merger Agreement is modified such that the time during which New CCE shall have the right to purchase all of TCCC’s right, title and interest in the German Entity (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is expanded from a period of eighteen (18) months to thirty-six (36) months after the date of the Merger Agreement to a period of (18) months to thirty-nine (39) months after the date of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) the survival period for the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as set forth in the first sentence of Section 9.1 therein, with certain exceptions, is reduced from one (1) year to nine (9) months from the Closing Date, as defined in the Merger Agreement.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. On February 16, 2011 (the “Effective Date”), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) of The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) amended and restated The Coca-Cola Company 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999 Stock Option Plan”), The Coca-Cola Company 2008 Stock Option Plan (the “2008 Stock Option Plan”), The Coca-Cola Company 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the “1983 Restricted Stock Plan”), The Coca-Cola Company 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the “1989 Restricted Stock Plan”) and The Coca-Cola Company Performance Incentive Plan (the “Performance Incentive Plan,” and together with the 1999 Stock Option Plan, the 2008 Stock Option Plan, the 1983 Restricted Stock Plan and the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan, the “Plans”). The 1999 Stock Option Plan, the 2008 Stock Option Plan and the 1983 Restricted Stock Plan were each amended to provide that awards granted after the Effective Date are subject to accelerated vesting following a change in control (as defined in the applicable Plan) only if an employee is terminated within two years following the change in control, unless the successor company does not assume the awards, in which case, accelerated vesting occurs upon a change in control (the “Double-Trigger Provision”). In addition, the 1999 Stock Option Plan, the 2008 Stock Option Plan and the 1983 Restricted Stock Plan were each amended to include a “clawback” provision with respect to the recapture of awards as required by the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any other law or the listing standards of the New York Stock Ex change (the “Clawback Provision”). The 1989 Restricted Plan was amended to (1) include the Double-Trigger Provision, (2) include the Clawback Provision, (3) establish “stock price,” “number of transactions (number of physical packages sold),” “productivity” and “service level” as additional performance criteria (the “Additional Performance Criteria”) for future grants of performance-based awards under the Plan and clarify how performance criteria can be applied and calculated, (4) provide that in the case of performance share units or other share units, the Compensation Committee has sole discretion to determine whether a recipient shall receive dividends or dividend equivalents prior to the release of the shares and whether shares will be issued after the date performance is certified or just prior to the release date. In additio n, the Compensation Committee adopted an amendment to the form of restricted stock award agreements relating to performance share units (“PSUs”) under the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan (the “Award Agreements”) to include the Double-Trigger Provision and provide that no dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid either during the performance period or the holding period. The executive officers of the Company are entitled to receive awards under the Award Agreements. The Performance Incentive Plan was amended to (1) include the Clawback Provision, (2) add the Additional Performance Criteria for future grants of performance-based awards under the Plan, remove “earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization” as a performance criteria and clarify how performance criteria can be applied and calculated and (3) increase the limit of future awards for any performance period to $12 million. The amendments to the Plans and adoption of the Award Agreements were approved by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the authority granted to the Compensation Committee under the terms of each of the respective Plans. The nature of these amendments did not require shareowner approval under the terms of the Plans, applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.

A copy of the Company’s press release announcing the election of Mr. Greenberg to the Board is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Related Person Transaction Disclosure The related person transaction disclosure presented below is for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2010. On October 2, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition (the “CCE Acquisition”) of the North American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (“CCE”). In connection with the CCE Acquisition, CCE was renamed Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”). The disclosure includes amounts related to CCR for the period of October 2 to December 31, 2010. Separate disclosure related to CCE is provided for the period of January 1 to October 1, 2010. Mr. Greenberg is President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of ACE Limited (ACE Limited, together with its subsidiaries, “ACE”). ACE has provided insurance related products and services to the Company since 1986. ACE provides traditional insurance coverage where the Company seeks to transfer risk and fronting services where the Company seeks to retain risk. The Company renews its insurance coverage on an annual basis. For the one-year period of November 1, 2009 to November 1, 2010, ACE was the primary insurer in the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ (“D&O”) liability tower and the fiduciary liability tower and the only insurer for employed lawyers liability. During this period, it also provided insurance coverage, but was not considered the primary insurer, for property insurance covering the Company’s plants and buildings. For the one-year period of November 1, 2010 to November 1, 2011, the Company changed its insurance coverage and ACE is no longer the primary insurer in the D&O liability tower, although it provides D&O liability coverage on an excess basis. Also, ACE no longer provides employed lawyers liability insurance but continues to provide the Company with primary coverage for fiduciary liability. Since October 2, 2010, CCR is covered under the Company’s insurance policies. ACE also provides fronting services to the Company by issuing contracts for U.S. and international general and product liability insurance, U.S. workers’ compensation insurance and global property insurance on behalf of the Company. In 2010, the Company paid ACE approximately $3.0 million for insurance premiums and approximately $937,000 in fronting fees for property and casualty insurance premiums. From January 1 to October 1, 2010, CCE paid ACE approximately $576,000 for insurance premiums and other services in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the terms of the Company’s insurance coverage and fronting arrangements with ACE are fair and reasonable and as favorable to the Company as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. On February 20, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) of The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) amended and restated The Coca-Cola Company 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999 Stock Option Plan”), The Coca-Cola Company 2008 Stock Option Plan (the “2008 Stock Option Plan”) and The Coca-Cola Company 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the “1989 Restricted Stock Plan”) (collectively, the “Plans”). In addition, the Compensation Committee adopted new form award agreements relating to performance share units (“PSUs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan (collectively, the “Award Agreements”). The 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2008 Stock Option Plan were each amended primarily to add a provision regarding involuntary termination for certain employees applicable to grants on or after the Effective Date. This provision provides that if an employee who is at least age 50 and has at least 10 years of service is involuntarily terminated because of a reduction in workforce, internal reorganization or a job elimination (the “Eligibility Criteria”), stock options held at least 12 months will continue to vest for four years from the termination date in accordance with the option vesting schedule provided in the grant. Such stock options would expire upon the earlier of four years from the termination date or the option expiration date provided in the grant agreement. For this provision to be applicable, the employee must sign a release of all claims and, if requested, an agreement on confidentiality and competition. The additional amendments to the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2008 Stock Option Plan were made to reflect the two-for-one stock split effected on July 27, 2012, update the name of the Company’s pension plan and clarify the provision applicable in the case of death during or after disability. The 1989 Restricted Stock Plan was amended to clarify the holding period provision in the Addendum related to French tax residents and to reflect the two-for-one stock split effected on July 27, 2012. New form award agreements relating to PSUs under the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan were adopted to add a provision regarding involuntary termination for certain employees, modify the provision related to the death of an employee and clarify certain matters applicable to French tax residents. The involuntary termination provision provides that, for PSUs held at least 12 months, if an employee has met the Eligibility Criteria, such PSU will remain subject to the applicable performance criterion and if met, a prorated number of shares will be granted based on the termination date. For this provision to be applicable, the employee must sign a release of all claims and, if requested, an agreement on confidentiality and competition. The death provision was amended to provide that, if death occurs during the performance period of a PSU, the employees’ estate would receive a cash payment equal to the target number of shares. The new form award agreements relating to RSUs under the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan were adopted to add an involuntary termination provision for certain employees. The provision provides that if an employee has met the Eligibility Criteria, the RSUs continue to vest according to the original schedule for up to four years and remain subject to the attainment of any performance criteria, if applicable. For this provision to be applicable, the employee must sign a release of all claims and, if requested, an agreement on confidentiality and competition. The amendments to the Plans and adoption of the Award Agreements were approved by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the authority granted to the Compensation Committee under the terms of each of the respective Plans. The nature of these amendments did not require shareowner approval under the terms of the Plans, applicable law "

Other Events On September 17, 2015, The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the tax years 2007 — 2009, after a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company’s United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets. The Company has followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses since the methodology was agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provides prospective penalty protection as long as the Company follows the prescribed methodology, and the Company has continued to abide by its terms for all subsequent years. The Company’s compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles covering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009. The IRS provided the Company no economist’s report or other detailed explanation for the asserted adjustments until approximately two weeks before the issuance of the Notice. The Company has also been notified by the IRS that a recommendation has been made to the Chief Counsel of the IRS that this matter be designated for litigation. The Company has requested a meeting with the Chief Counsel. If the matter is designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advanced Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program. The Company firmly believes that the assessments are without merit and plans to pursue all administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. Initially, the Company expects to file a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position and is confident in its ability to prevail on the merits. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The Company believes that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that it has adequate tax reserves for all tax matters. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, the assessed tax and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As a result, our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. As previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2015 Form 10-K”), effective January 1, 2016, the following accounting guidance became effective for the Company with retrospective application: (i) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") in April 2015, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, and (ii) ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), issued by the FASB in April 2015, which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-07 are referred to herein as the “Accounting Standards Updates”). The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to (i) revise historical operating segment information contained in the 2015 Form 10-K to correspond with the Company's current reportable operating segments and (ii) revise other financial and related information to reflect the retrospective application of the Accounting Standards Updates. Exhibit 99.1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference, contains items from the 2015 Form 10-K, updated to reflect revised operating segment information as well the retrospective application of the Accounting Standards Updates. The Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 reflects the Company's currently reportable operating segments. The updates to the 2015 Form 10-K relate solely to the presentation of operating segment-specific information and the impact of the retrospective application of the Accounting Standards Updates as described above and do not affect the Company's previously reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. All other information in the 2015 Form 10-K remains unchanged and has not been otherwise updated for events or developments that occurred subsequent to the filing of the 2015 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As COVID-19 continues to spread and significantly impact various markets around the world, including the United States, the company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to ensure continued operations, while also taking all necessary steps to keep our teams healthy and safe. Our teams have conducted preparedness exercises of their business continuity plans. We tested our IT infrastructure in advance, including at our global headquarters, through preparedness exercises. In line with recommendations to reduce large gatherings and increase social distancing, the company has asked many office-based employees to work remotely. We are also working closely with our bottling partners on contingency planning for continuous supply and, at this stage, we do not foresee any near-term disruptions in concentrate or beverage base production. Since our last guidance update, local market policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have significantly increased. These initiatives include the direction to refrain from dining at restaurants, the cancellation of major sporting and entertainment events, material reduction in travel, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home policies. These initiatives, in combination with the latest movements in foreign exchange rates, will have a negative impact on our full year financial and operating results and, therefore, we do not expect to achieve our previously provided full year guidance. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing, there is uncertainty around its ultimate impact; therefore, the negative impact on our financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact could be material. We expect to provide an update during our Q1 2020 earnings release and call. Item 9.01(d). Financial Statements and Exhibits.

On August 28, 2020, The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) announced strategic steps to reorganize its business for future growth. The Company will create new operating units focused on regional and local execution that will work closely with five marketing category leadership teams that span the globe to rapidly scale ideas. The structure will be supported by the Company’s newly created Platform Services organization, which will provide global services and enhanced expertise across a range of critical capabilities. The Company’s structural changes will result in the reallocation of people and resources, which will include voluntary and involuntary reductions in employees. The first stage of reductions will be carried out through a voluntary separation program that will give eligible employees the option of taking a separation package that will include severance benefits consisting of cash, equity and health and welfare coverage. The voluntary program will first be offered to approximately 4,000 employees in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico who have a most-recent hire date on or before September 1, 2017. A similar program will be offered in many countries internationally. The voluntary program is expected to reduce the number of involuntary separations. approximately $350 million to $550 million in severance, stock compensation and employee benefits related expenses as a result of these actions. The Company expects that these expenses will primarily be incurred beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021. These amounts are estimates. Actual amounts may vary based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the number of employees who are impacted through both the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions. Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. As discussed above, the Company will create nine new operating units in order to help streamline the organization by replacing current business units and groups. The Company’s current model includes 17 business units that sit under four geographical segments, plus Global Ventures and the Bottling Investments Group. Moving forward, the operational side of the business will consist of nine operating units that will sit under our four geographical segments, along with Global Ventures and the Bottling Investments Group. Upon completion of these structural changes, Manuel Arroyo will continue in his role as Chief Marketing Officer but will no longer serve as President, Asia Pacific Group.

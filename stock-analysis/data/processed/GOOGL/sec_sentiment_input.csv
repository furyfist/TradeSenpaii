(“Google”), the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, for new notes issued by the Company (as described below). Pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the aggregate principal amounts of the Google Notes set forth below were validly tendered and accepted and subsequently cancelled: (i) $826,657,000 aggregate principal amount of Old 2021 Notes; and (ii) $853,693,000 aggregate principal amount of Old 2024 Notes. Following such cancellation, $173,343,000 aggregate principal amount of Old 2021 Notes and $146,307,000 aggregate principal amount of Old 2024 Notes remain outstanding. In connection with the Exchange Offers, the Company also solicited consents from holders of the Google Notes to amend (the “Proposed Amendments”) the indenture governing the Google Notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, including the merger covenant and the reporting covenant. Prior to the acceptance for exchange of the validly tendered Google Notes by the Company, Google received the requisite number of consents to adopt the Proposed Amendments, entered into the first supplemental indenture, dated as of April 27, 2016 (the “Google First Supplemental Indenture”), between Google and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), and, with respect to each series of Google Notes that remain outstanding after the settlement of the Exchange Offers, amended the indenture governing the Google Notes to adopt the Proposed Amendments. In connection with the settlement of the Exchange Offers, on April 27, 2016, the Company issued (i) $826,657,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and (ii) $853,693,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes” and, together with the 2021 Notes, the “Notes”) in exchange for the validly tendered and accepted Google Notes. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-209515) which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 12, 2016, was amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on March 29, 2016 and became effective on April 7, 2016. The terms of the Notes are further described in the Company’s prospectus dated April 7, 2016, as filed with the SEC under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Act on that date. The Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Company and will rank equally with each other and with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company from time to time outstanding.

Other Events. Alphabet Inc. (the ""Company"") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K solely to recast certain information in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended (the ""2015 Form 10-K""), in connection with its adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) ""Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation"" , Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02) ""Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis"" , and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09), ""Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"" beginning in the first quarter of 2016. ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities. The amendment to the consolidation guidance requires companies with interests in development stage entities to reassess whether such entities are variable interest entities under ASC Topic 810, ""Consolidation . "" We adopted this standard on a retrospective basis and have included additional disclosures related to certain entities that are now considered variable interest entities upon adoption. ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We adopted this standard on a retrospective basis which resulted in additional investments being considered variable interest entities and additional disclosures as applicable. ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions and requires companies to present excess tax benefits as operating activities in the statement of cash flows, among other changes. We have retrospectively adjusted the presentation of excess tax benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following information included in the 2015 Form 10-K is being recasted in the exhibits attached to, and included in, this Current Report on Form 8-K to reflect the impact from the adoptions of ASU 2014-10, ASU 2015-02 and ASU 2016-09.

Founders' Letter A is for Alphabet Hard to believe we are about a quarter short of two years of announcing Alphabet. It’s been busy! I certainly feel Alphabet is working well, and as intended (see the original “G is for Google” announcement). At the time, I wrote that “Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.” The new structure has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need. Sergey and I are working well together on the overall Alphabet direction and providing guidance to the companies. Sundar is doing great as Google CEO. It’s certainly a big job and we are very lucky to have him. He’ll probably write this letter again in the future as he has in the past, so I won’t speak too much for him on the Google related topics in this one. But, I’m excited about how he is leading the company with a focus on machine learning and AI. We took a big step in that direction with the Google Assistant, and built it into a new family of hardware devices like the Pixel and Google Home. There’s a lot more to come. We’ve had a number of significant things happen on the Alphabet side since I last wrote. A number of our projects became companies, with more autonomy and dedicated leadership. Waymo is the new self-driving car company formed from Project Chauffeur at X. John Krafcik is the new CEO and brings significant auto industry experience. I love the name and I love even more the excitement you can see when you visit with them! They also formed a partnership with Fiat Chrysler around their new plug-in hybrid Pacifica minivan which I see driving around the Waymo offices with lots of sensors on it. I can’t wait until Waymo launches. Verily Life Sciences launched in December 2015 with Andy Conrad as founding CEO, also coming out of X. They have launched myriad efforts and raised $800M from Temasek, who joined their board and will help with Asian expansion. I’m very fond of their Debug project, which aims to stop mosquitoes in their tracks. It has been running for a while, showing some good foresight because it was started before Zika became a big concern. In June 2016, Marwan Fawaz became CEO of Nest. He has been doing great against their plan, and we have really been enjoying working with him! I recommend you buy all their excellent products including indoor and outdoor cameras, learning thermostats, and smoke alarms. Very recently Greg McCray started as CEO of Google Fiber. I’ve been enjoying working with him and his team and he has rapidly been getting up to speed. He visited all of our Fiber cities so quickly that I think he was still a bit out of breath when he got back to Mountain View! We have made significant investments in bringing gigabit fiber internet to lots of happy customers and I’m excited about our opportunities to do it better. We have many other efforts within Alphabet. Calico CEO Art Levinson, former CEO of Genentech, is building an amazing research and development company focused on aging. We also have newly branded investment arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) which are doing well. Sergey is continuing to spend time working with the X moonshot factory. They have a number of efforts like Wing, which is doing drone delivery. I also can’t wait for them to launch! With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility. We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success. Our recent launch of Waymo was a great example of our learnings. In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good. Machine learning and all the efforts around Google Brain and DeepMind are good examples. Google Cloud led by Diane Greene is doing a fabulous job of getting our machine learning hardware and software out to everyone. We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out. Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more. So in conclusion, Sergey and I are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts. I still see amazing opportunities that just aren’t quite fully developed yet—and helping making them real is what I get excited about. - Larry Page, CEO, Alphabet Important Information SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS THAT ALPHABET WILL FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “ SEC ”) CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. On December 17, 2019, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) of Alphabet Inc. (“ Alphabet ”) approved a new compensation arrangement for Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google LLC (“ Google ”). In recognition of his expanded role as CEO of Alphabet and Google, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board determined to increase Mr. Pichai’s salary to $2,000,000 effective January 1, 2020, and to provide equity awards in the form of performance stock units (“ PSUs ”) and restricted stock units (“ GSUs ”). The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board determined that the inclusion of relative Total Shareholder Return (“ TSR ”) with respect to the PSUs further aligns compensation to long-term shareholder value creation and rewards the company’s performance relative to the S&P 100. The 2019 equity awards consist of both performance-based and time-based equity, vesting from 2020 through 2022. Mr. Pichai’s last GSU award was granted in 2016. As a result, the 2019 awards also include a one-time transitional grant of time-based GSUs vesting during 2020. On December 19, 2019, Mr. Pichai was granted an award consisting of two tranches of PSUs with a target value of $45,000,000 each. The target number of PSUs for each tranche was calculated by dividing the target value of $45,000,000 by the average closing price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of November 2019 (the “ Average Closing Price ”). The PSUs will vest, if at all, based on the TSR performance of Alphabet relative to the companies comprising the S&P 100 over a 2020-2021 performance period for the first tranche and over a 2020-2022 performance period for the second tranche, subject to continued employment. Depending upon performance, the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0%-200% of target. Upon vesting, each PSU will entitle Mr. Pichai to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, unvested PSUs with respect to a tranche will immediately vest, assuming target (or actual if the performance period ended prior to death) and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by Alphabet without cause, PSUs will vest based on actual performance but will be prorated based on the number of calendar days in the performance period Mr. Pichai performed services and any remaining unvested PSUs will be forfeited. The PSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan. The foregoing description is only a summary of the terms of the PSU award and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Performance Stock Unit Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Alphabet’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. On December 19, 2019, Mr. Pichai was granted an award of $120,000,000 in the form of GSUs. The number of GSUs comprising the grant was calculated by dividing the equity award amount by the Average Closing Price. These GSUs will vest as follows: 1/12th will vest on March 25, 2020 and an additional 1/12th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment. Mr. Pichai also will be granted a transitional award of $30,000,000 in the form of GSUs with the exact number of GSUs calculated as set forth above. These transitional GSUs will vest 1/4th on March 25, 2020 and an additional 1/4th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment. Upon vesting, each GSU will entitle Mr. Pichai to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, all unvested GSUs will immediately vest in full and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. All GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board ­has approved the amendment of Alphabet’s form of restricted stock unit agreement under Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan for future grants, such that, similar to all other Alphabet employees, GSUs granted to directors and executive officers of Alphabet (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder) will immediately vest in full and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock upon termination of service on the Board, or of employment, by reason of death.",1105

On April 6, 2021, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) of Alphabet Inc. (“ Alphabet ”) approved a new compensation arrangement for Ruth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google LLC. Ms. Porat was granted an equity award consisting of one tranche of performance stock units (“ PSUs ”) with a target value of $5,000,000. The target number of PSUs was calculated by dividing the target value of $5,000,000 by the average closing price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of March 2021 (the “ Average Closing Price ”). The PSUs will vest, if at all, based on the Total Shareholder Return (“ TSR ”) performance of Alphabet relative to the companies comprising the S&P 100 over a 2021-2023 performance period, subject to continued employment. Depending upon performance, the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0%-200% of target. Upon vesting, each PSU will entitle Ms. Porat to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, unvested PSUs will immediately vest, assuming target (or actual if the performance period ended prior to death) and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by Alphabet without cause, PSUs will vest based on actual performance but will be prorated based on the number of calendar days in the performance period Ms. Porat performed services and any remaining unvested PSUs will be forfeited. The PSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan. This grant is intended to be part of a transition to a performance-based equity structure for Ms. Porat. Going forward, we anticipate that a portion of Ms. Porat’s equity compensation will be granted in the form of PSUs. The foregoing description is only a summary of the terms of the PSU award and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Performance Stock Unit Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Alphabet’s Form 10-Q. Ms. Porat was also granted an award of $5,000,000 in the form of restricted stock units (“ GSUs ”). The number of GSUs comprising the grant was calculated by dividing the equity award amount by the Average Closing Price. These GSUs will vest as follows: 1/4th will vest on March 25, 2022 and an additional 1/4th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment. Upon vesting, each GSU will entitle Ms. Porat to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, all unvested GSUs will immediately vest in full and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. All GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan.",811

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. On December 28, 2021, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”) approved a new compensation arrangement for members of its senior executive team for 2022, including the following executive officers: Ruth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google LLC (“Google”); Prabhakar Raghavan, Senior Vice President, Google; Philipp Schindler, Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer, Google; and Kent Walker, President, Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer of Alphabet and Google. Effective January 2022, the base salaries of each of Ms. Porat, Mr. Raghavan, Mr. Schindler, and Mr. Walker will be increased from $650,000 to $1,000,000. Each of Ms. Porat, Mr. Raghavan, Mr. Schindler, and Mr. Walker will be eligible to participate in a maximum $2,000,000 annual bonus program, based on contributions to Google's performance against social and environmental goals for 2022. Actual bonus payouts will be reduced if target performance is not met. In addition, the Board approved equity awards, which are expected to be granted on January 5, 2022, to each of Ms. Porat, Mr. Raghavan, Mr. Schindler, and Mr. Walker. • Ms. Porat will be granted one tranche of performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a target value of $5,000,000, and one tranche of restricted stock units (“GSUs”) in the amount of $18,000,000. • Mr. Raghavan will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $12,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $23,000,000. • Mr. Schindler will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $12,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $23,000,000. • Mr. Walker will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $5,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $18,000,000. The target number of PSUs will be calculated by dividing the target value by the average closing price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of December 2021 (the “Average Closing Price”). The PSUs will vest, if at all, based on the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance of Alphabet relative to the companies comprising the S&P 100 over a 2022-2024 performance period, subject to continued employment. Depending upon performance, the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0%-200% of target. Upon vesting, each PSU will entitle the grantee to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, unvested PSUs will immediately vest, as though target performance had been achieved (or based on actual performance if the performance period ended prior to death), and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by Alphabet without cause, PSUs will vest based on actual performance, but will be prorated based on the number of calendar days in the performance period the grantee performed services and any remaining unvested PSUs will be forfeited. The PSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan. The foregoing description is only a summary of the terms of the PSU award and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the PSU Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Alphabet’s Form 10-K. The number of GSUs comprising the grant will be calculated by dividing the equity award amount by the Average Closing Price. These GSUs will vest as follows: 1/12th will vest on March 25, 2022 and an additional 1/12th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment. Upon vesting, each GSU will entitle the grantee to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, all unvested GSUs will immediately vest in full and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C stock. All GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan.",1017

On July 12, 2022, Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet Inc. and Google LLC (“ Google ”), shared the following message with Google employees: Hi Googlers, Hard to believe we’re already through the first half of 2022. It’s the right opportunity to thank everyone for the great work so far this year, and to share how my Leads and I are thinking about H2. The uncertain global economic outlook has been top of mind. Like all companies, we’re not immune to economic headwinds. Something I cherish about our culture is that we’ve never viewed these types of challenges as obstacles. Instead, we’ve seen them as opportunities to deepen our focus and invest for the long term. In these moments, I turn to our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. It’s what inspired me to join the company 18 years ago, and what makes me so optimistic about the impact we are able to have on the world. Knowledge and computing are how we drive our mission forward. That’s the lens we use to decide where to invest — whether it’s in areas like Search, Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Hardware, the teams that support them, or in the AI that enables more helpful products and services. We help people and society when we focus on what we do best, and do it really well. The investments we’ve made in the first half of the year reflect this vision. In Q2 alone, we added approximately 10,000 Googlers, and have a strong number of commitments for Q3 start dates which reflects, in part, the seasonal college recruiting calendar. These are extraordinary numbers, and they show our excitement about long-term opportunities, even in uncertain times. Because of the hiring progress achieved so far this year, we’ll be slowing the pace of hiring for the rest of the year, while still supporting our most important opportunities. For the balance of 2022 and 2023, we’ll focus our hiring on engineering, technical and other critical roles, and make sure the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities. Moving forward, we need to be more entrepreneurial, working with greater urgency, sharper focus, and more hunger than we’ve shown on sunnier days. In some cases, that means consolidating where investments overlap and streamlining processes. In other cases, that means pausing development and re-deploying resources to higher priority areas. Making the company more efficient is up to all of us — we’ll be creating more ways for you all to engage and share ideas to help, so stay tuned. Scarcity breeds clarity — this is something we have been saying since the earliest days of Google. It’s what drives focus and creativity that ultimately leads to better products that help people all over the world.

These GSUs will vest at the rate of 25% on the 25th day of the month in which the grant’s first anniversary occurs, and an additional 1/48th will vest on the 25th day of each month thereafter, subject to continued service on the Board on the applicable vesting dates.

On December 19, 2022, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee (the “ Committee ”) of the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc. (“ Alphabet ”) approved a new equity award for Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google LLC (“ CEO ”). The Committee currently follows a triennial grant cycle for CEO equity awards. Mr. Pichai’s last equity award was granted in December 2019. As with the 2019 award, the award consists of both performance-based and time-based equity. The vesting of a significant portion of the award will depend on Alphabet’s total shareholder return (relative to S&P 100 companies) (“ TSR ”), and this performance-based equity may not vest at all. The Committee recognizes Mr. Pichai’s strong performance as CEO. The on-target value of the award is unchanged from the 2019 award. However, relative to the 2019 award, the Committee made two design changes such that more of the award’s vesting dependent on performance: (1) increased the proportion of performance stock units (“ PSUs ”) to 60% from 43%, and (2) increased the performance requirement for on-target PSU payout to 55th percentile from 50th percentile of TSR. These changes further align Mr. Pichai’s compensation to long-term shareholder value creation and Alphabet’s stock performance relative to the S&P 100 over the applicable performance periods. For this triennial award, Mr. Pichai was granted two tranches of PSUs with a target value of $63,000,000 each. The target number of PSUs was calculated by dividing the target value of the total PSU grant by the average closing price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of November 2022 (the “ Average Closing Price ”). The PSUs will vest, if at all, based on the TSR performance over a 2023-2024 performance period for the first tranche and over a 2023-2025 performance period for the second tranche, subject to continued employment on each applicable vesting date. Depending upon Alphabet’s TSR performance, the number of PSUs that vest in a tranche will range from 0%-200% of target. Each vested PSU will entitle Mr. Pichai to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, unvested PSUs with respect to a tranche will immediately vest at target (or actual if the performance period ended prior to death). Upon termination of employment by Alphabet without cause, PSUs will vest based on actual performance but will be prorated based on the number of calendar days in the performance period that Mr. Pichai performed services and any remaining unvested PSUs will be forfeited. The PSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan and the applicable PSU agreement. The foregoing description is only a summary of the terms of the PSU award and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Mr. Pichai’s form PSU agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Alphabet’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. The triennial award also included a grant of $84,000,000 in the form of Alphabet restricted stock units (“ GSUs ”). The number of GSUs was calculated by dividing the GSU award amount by the Average Closing Price. These GSUs will vest over three years as follows: 1/12th will vest on March 25, 2023, and an additional 1/12th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment on each applicable vesting date. Upon vesting, each GSU will entitle Mr. Pichai to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, all unvested GSUs will immediately vest. All GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan and the applicable GSU agreement.",976

On January 20, 2023, Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet Inc. and Google LLC (“ Google ”), shared the following message with Google employees: Googlers, I have some difficult news to share. We’ve decided to reduce our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles. We’ve already sent a separate email to employees in the U.S. who are affected. In other countries, this process will take longer due to local laws and practices. This will mean saying goodbye to some incredibly talented people we worked hard to hire and have loved working with. I’m deeply sorry for that. The fact that these changes will impact the lives of Googlers weighs heavily on me, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today. I am confident about the huge opportunity in front of us thanks to the strength of our mission, the value of our products and services, and our early investments in AI. To fully capture it, we’ll need to make tough choices. So, we’ve undertaken a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company. The roles we’re eliminating reflect the outcome of that review. They cut across Alphabet, product areas, functions, levels and regions. To the Googlers who are leaving us: Thank you for working so hard to help people and businesses everywhere. Your contributions have been invaluable and we are grateful for them. While this transition won’t be easy, we’re going to support employees as they look for their next opportunity (you can find more detail here). In the U.S.: We’ll pay employees during the full notification period (minimum 60 days). We’ll also offer a severance package starting at 16 weeks salary plus two weeks for every additional year at Google, and accelerate at least 16 weeks of GSU vesting. We’ll pay 2022 bonuses and remaining vacation time. We’ll be offering 6 months of healthcare, job placement services, and immigration support for those affected. Outside the U.S., we’ll support employees in line with local practices. As an almost 25-year-old company, we’re bound to go through difficult economic cycles. These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities. Being constrained in some areas allows us to bet big on others. Pivoting the company to be AI-first years ago led to groundbreaking advances across our businesses and the whole industry. Thanks to those early investments, Google’s products are better than ever. And, we’re getting ready to share some entirely new experiences for users, developers and businesses, too. We have a substantial opportunity in front of us with AI across our products and are prepared to approach it boldly and responsibly. All this work is a continuation of the “healthy disregard for the impossible” that’s been core to our culture from the beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. That’s why I remain optimistic about our ability to deliver on our mission, even on our toughest days. Today is certainly one of them. I’m sure you have many questions about how we’ll move forward. We’ll be organizing a town hall on Monday. Check your calendar for details. Until then, please take good care of yourselves as you absorb this difficult news. As part of that, if you are just starting your work day, please feel free to work from home today. -Sundar",940

The equity awards, which are expected to be granted on May 3, 2023 (the first Wednesday of the month following LDICC approval), are as follows: Ms. Porat will be granted one tranche of performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a target value of $5,000,000, and one tranche of restricted stock units (“GSUs”) in the amount of $18,000,000. Mr. Raghavan will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $12,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $23,000,000. Mr. Schindler will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $12,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $23,000,000. Mr. Walker will be granted one tranche of PSUs with a target value of $5,000,000, and one tranche of GSUs in the amount of $18,000,000. The number of PSUs represented by the target value will be calculated by dividing the target value by the average closing price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of April 2023 (the “Average Closing Price”) and rounding up the next full unit. The PSUs will vest, if at all, based on the Total Shareholder Return performance of Alphabet relative to the companies comprising the S&P 100 over a 2023-2025 performance period, subject to continued employment. Depending upon performance, the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0%-200% of target. Upon vesting, each PSU will entitle the grantee to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, unvested PSUs will immediately vest, as though target performance had been achieved (or based on actual performance if the performance period ended prior to death), and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by Alphabet without cause, PSUs will vest based on actual performance, but will be prorated based on the number of calendar days in the performance period the grantee performed services and any remaining unvested PSUs will be forfeited. The PSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan. The foregoing description is only a summary of the terms of the PSU award and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the PSU Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Alphabet’s Form 10-Q. The number of GSUs comprising the grant will be calculated by dividing the equity award amount by the Average Closing Price. These GSUs will vest as follows: 1/6th will vest on June 25, 2023 and an additional 1/12th will vest quarterly thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued employment. Upon vesting, each GSU will entitle the grantee to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. Upon termination of employment by reason of death, all unvested GSUs will immediately vest in full and be settled in shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock. All GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Alphabet’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan.",921

Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding the acquisition of Wiz by Google. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause Alphabet Inc.'s (the “company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the risk that the closing conditions for the acquisition will not be satisfied, including the risk that the requisite regulatory approvals will not be obtained; the risk that the definitive agreement relating to the acquisition will be terminated prior to closing; the possibility that the acquisition will not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all; potential adverse effects to the businesses of the company or Wiz during the pendency of the acquisition; our ability to successfully integrate Wiz or other businesses that we may acquire in the future; our ability to achieve the benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition of Wiz; the potential negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if we fail to achieve the benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition of Wiz or if these benefits take longer to achieve than expected; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports the company has filed previously with the SEC, such as its Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, which speak as of the respective date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

The U.S. consumer businesses continued to deliver strong unit volume gains during October-December, including record shipments in December. International achieved double-digit volume growth, despite difficult economic conditions in many major markets. Volume growth was particularly strong in the Far East, Latin America and Eastern Europe.

Excluding this charge, earnings increased 16% over earnings from the same period last year. Earnings per share excluding this onetime item were $.81, also up 16% from last year. The earnings improvement was largely due to lower costs and a 6% increase in worldwide unit volume.

1994-11-10,10-Q,0000080424-94-000029,"Worldwide net earnings for the July-September quarter achieved a record level of $792 million, or $1.12 per share, an 18% increase over the same quarter in the prior year. First quarter earnings for the prior year were $670 million or $.95 per share. The earnings improvement reflects strong worldwide unit volume growth and good cost control throughout the Company. Worldwide net sales for the July-September quarter increased 8% from the same three months a year ago to a record level of $8.2 billion. This growth was driven by unit volume increases. Worldwide unit volume increased 10%, which compares to a 5% volume growth in fiscal year 1994. Acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 3 percentage points to the volume growth in this quarter. Net earnings in the United States increased 12% versus the first quarter last year, reflecting increases in Laundry & Cleaning, Paper and Food & Beverage sectors again due to volume growth and cost control. Sales in the United States increased 6% on an equal growth in unit volume. The Laundry & Cleaning sector increased unit volume by 10%, led by growth in the Laundry Detergent and Fabric Conditioners categories, reflecting the effect of new product initiatives. The Food & Beverage sector recorded a small unit volume decline, entirely due to the contraction of the coffee market resulting from sharp price increases following crop freezes in Brazil. On the balance of the Food & Beverage line there were broadly based volume gains. The Paper sector increased unit volume 12% on broadly based market share gains except for the Diaper category, where market share was flat. The Tissue/Towel category recorded significant gains due importantly to new product initiatives. The Beauty Care business also increased unit volume, while Health Care was about equal to year ago. Total International net earnings increased 23% over the first quarter a year ago, on a sales increase of 8% and a unit volume increase of 13%. The increase in earnings was driven by unit volume growth and continued cost reduction efforts. The lower rate of sales versus unit volume growth was in large part due to more competitive pricing across most regions. Exchange rates did not have a significant effect on sales or net earnings for the quarter. Europe's unit volume increased 13% led by broadly based gains in the Health & Beauty Care sector and Eastern European region. The European Laundry, Paper and Food & Beverage businesses did well, with volume up 12% overall. The balance of International unit volume also advanced by 13% with every region except Latin America growing at a double digit rate. The economic and political conditions in Mexico and Venezuela slowed volume advances in the region. Globally, there are signs of upward pressure on costs, not only for green coffee beans, but also for pulp and petrochemicals. Although the prices for many of these materials are up from unusually depressed levels, the increases may put pressure on pricing. Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ending June 30, 1993 a pre-tax reserve of $2,402 million was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separation- related activities (86% of the total). The following information relates to the 1993 reserve (in millions of Original Balance July-Sept.

Execution of the restructuring program is on track and the cost of completing it is expected to approximate the original estimates. As anticipated, charges for the disposal of fixed assets will lag behind spending for separation-related programs. We have announced more than half of the sites and production modules to be closed in order to provide early notice to employees. However, relatively few of these facilities have been totally shut down at this time. Benefits continue to be obtained from the restructuring program. We estimate that incremental savings of about $60 million after-tax were achieved in the July-September 1994 quarter. This brings cumulative restructuring savings to about half of the $500 million after-tax objective established in June, 1993. These amounts reflect estimated gross savings, which may be offset to some degree by other actions, such as pricing or research and development spending.

Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06 compared to $.92 per share for the second quarter of the prior year, also a 15% increase. Worldwide net sales for the quarter increased 9% over the same quarter of the prior year to $8.5 billion. Strong unit volume growth continued, with worldwide unit shipments increasing 9% over the same quarter in the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 3% of the quarter's volume growth. Favorable exchange rates contributed approximately 2% to the sales and earnings growth for the quarter. Results for the first six months of the fiscal year reflect continued volume growth and cost control efforts throughout the company. Worldwide net earnings for the July-December period were $1,542, or $2.18 per share, a 17% increase over the same period of the prior year. Year to date sales were $16.6 billion, up 8% compared to $15.4 billion for this period of the prior fiscal year. Year to date volume Net earnings in the United States increased 7% for the quarter, on a 6% sales growth versus the same period a year ago. The earnings increase reflects unit volume growth in all sectors, as well as benefits from restructuring actions begun in the prior year. Overall, unit volume increased 3%. The Laundry & Cleaning sector increased unit volume in spite of competitive pressure and responses to new initiatives in the Fabric Conditioners category. The Food & Beverage sector unit volume benefited from strong shipments in the Juice and Shortening & Oils categories. In the Paper sector, volume gains were driven by continued strength in the Tissue/Towel category. Diaper volume was down due, in part, to announced pricing reductions which will take effect in the January-March quarter. Driven by double-digit volume growth in the Hair Care category, the Beauty Care business also increased unit volume 2%, excluding the discontinued Clarion business. The Health Care business increased unit volume 2%. The primary driver of the growth was Aleve, offsetting lower volumes in respiratory attributable to a mild cough and cold season. Year to date earnings for the United States have increased 10% over the first half of the prior fiscal year. The earnings increase is attributable to a 6% increase in sales on a 5% unit volume growth, combined with the benefits of continued cost reduction efforts. Unit volume growth has been achieved by nearly all sectors. Food and Beverage year-to-date unit volume is down slightly due to the impact of the contraction of the coffee market following the crop freeze in Total international earnings increased 20% over the same quarter of the prior year on a sales increase of 8%. Unit volume increased 15%. The difference between sales and volume growth is largely due to competitive pricing in a number of markets. Favorable exchange rates contributed 4% to the sales growth and 5% to earnings growth. Europe posted strong net earnings gains, as broadly-based unit volume growth of 14% and continued cost reduction benefits offset the impact of reduced pricing. The European Laundry business continues to be strong, attaining record market share. The balance of international achieved 16% unit volume growth. Cost control efforts contributed to attaining double digit growth in quarterly earnings for this segment. The devaluation of the Mexican peso did not adversely impact the quarterly results. Translation of the net assets in Mexico resulted in a charge to the cumulative translation component of shareholders' equity, without significant impact to total equity. The devaluation of the Mexican peso is not expected to significantly impact results For the first half of the fiscal year, International earnings have increased 22% over the prior comparable period. Year to date sales growth was 8% on a 15% unit volume growth, reflecting pricing actions in a number of markets. International unit volume has increased at a double digit rate across all regions except Latin America where the economic conditions in Mexico and Venezuela have slowed volume growth. Favorable exchange rates contributed 3% to the sales and earnings growth for the first six months. Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ending June 30, 1993, a pre-tax reserve of $2,402 million was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separation-related costs (86% of the total). The following information relates to the June 1993 reserve (in millions of dollars pre-tax): Original Balance July-Dec Balance Reserve 6/30/94 Charges 12/31/94 Separation-related costs $ 965 $ 596 $134 $ 462 Disposals of Fixed Assets 1,109 960 116 844 Includes separation allowances and related benefits, out placement services, and personnel relocation costs. Includes closing, environmental remediation and contract termination costs for sites shut down or divested, offset by proceeds from asset sales. No cost element within this category exceeds 5% of the total reserve. Execution of the restructuring program is on track and the cost of completing it is expected to approximate the original estimates. As anticipated, charges for the disposal of fixed assets will lag behind spending for separation-related programs. We have announced more than half of the sites and production modules to be closed in order to provide advance notice to employees. However, relatively few of these facilities have been totally shut down at this time. Benefits continue to be obtained from the restructuring program. We estimate that incremental savings of almost $65 million after tax were achieved in the October-December quarter, bringing cumulative restructuring savings to approximately two-thirds of the $500 million after-tax objective established in June 1993. These amounts reflect estimated gross savings, which may be offset to some degree by other actions, such as pricing or research and development spending. Based on the information currently available, the recent earthquake in Kobe, Japan will result in a $50 million after-tax charge to earnings in the January-March quarter for employee assistance, clean-up and repair of facilities and other incremental expenses directly associated with the earthquake. Four of five plants in Japan were not affected by the earthquake. The Akashi plant, which produces paper products, suffered some damage and is being repaired currently. Customers are being supplied from existing inventory and another P&G plant in Japan. P&G's Japan headquarters and technical center on Rokko Island suffered some damage, but based on initial assessments, the basic structure appears sound. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",1075
1995-05-11,10-Q,0000080424-95-000009,"Worldwide net earnings for the quarter ending March 31, 1995 were $631 million, 31% above the same quarter in the prior year, including a $50 million charge for incremental costs associated with the January earthquake in Japan. Net earnings for the same period of the prior fiscal year were $482 million, including a $102 million charge related to two interest rate swap contracts. Excluding the unusual items in both years, net earnings were $681 million, a 17% increase over the third quarter of the prior year, and earnings per share were $.95, Worldwide net sales for the quarter increased 12% over the same quarter of the prior year to $8,312 million. Strong unit volume growth continued, with a worldwide increase of 12% over the same quarter a year ago. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2% to the Year-to-date results reflect strong unit volume growth and cost containment efforts, despite upward pressure on raw material prices. Worldwide net earnings for the first nine months of the fiscal year were $2,173 million compared to $1,805 million in the prior year, a 20% increase, including the cost associated with the Japan earthquake and the $102 million charge related to two interest rate contracts, in the respective periods. Excluding the unusual items in both years, earnings and earnings per share increased 17% for the July-March period to $2,223 million and $3.13 per share, respectively. The United States achieved 10% sales growth in the quarter on a 9% unit volume increase, which is the largest year-to-year increase in unit volume in six years. Excellent unit volume growth was achieved by all sectors, with double-digit volume increases in the Health Care and Beauty Care businesses. The Diaper category unit volume continued to show a year-to-year volume decline in the current quarter, although volume increased over the prior quarter following the introduction of a new product and price reductions. In addition, competitive activity in the Shortenings & Oils and Hard Surface Cleaners categories negatively impacted unit volume growth. Strong growth in the Laundry, Fabric Conditioners and Tissue/Towel categories more than offset those impacts. Positive product mix impacts offset the effect of competitive pricing in several categories, primarily diapers. United States net earnings increased 8% in the third quarter. The benefit of cost containment efforts was impacted by higher raw material prices, primarily pulp, and continued research and development investment, primarily in pharmaceuticals. Selling price increases on tissue and towel products have recently been announced in response to increased pulp prices. Year-to-date earnings in the United States have increased 9% over the first nine months of the prior year. The earnings increase reflects a 7% increase in sales on a 6% unit volume increase. The benefits of continued cost containment efforts have been reduced by increased raw material prices. Unit volume growth increased across all sectors year to date, led by double-digit growth in the Beauty Care business. International volume increased 14% over the same quarter of the prior year. Continued competitive pricing in a number of markets limited sales growth to 11%. International earnings increased 23% for the quarter, reflecting aggressive cost reduction efforts. The impact of favorable exchange rates in Central Europe and Japan has offset the Mexican peso devaluation resulting in a small net positive impact on International sales and earnings. Europe continued to post strong net earnings gains, as unit volume growth of 15% and lower costs offset the impact of reduced pricing. The European Laundry business remains strong, supplemented by continued growth in the Health Care and Beauty Care businesses. The European Paper business continued to grow, with strength in both diapers and feminine hygiene products. The balance of International achieved 14% unit volume growth. Solid quarterly net earnings growth for this segment is attributable to aggressive cost increase recovery in Latin America. Unit volume in Japan was up, despite the temporary shut down of the Akashi paper plant due to the January earthquake. The impact of the delays is not expected to materially impact future results. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, International earnings have increased 22% over the prior period. Year-to-date sales growth of 9% was driven by 15% unit volume growth, reflecting continued competitive pricing in a number of markets. Unit volume growth and cost containment efforts continue to drive earnings growth in substantially all regions. On a year-to-date basis, countervailing exchange rate changes resulted in an immaterial impact on OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE) - NET As discussed previously, the third quarter and year-to-date amounts of other income/(expense) - net include unusual items in both years. The current periods reflect a $77 million pre-tax charge for incremental costs associated with the January earthquake in Japan. This charge reflects the cost of employee assistance, cleanup and repair of facilities, and non-recurring expenses directly associated with the earthquake. The prior year periods include a $157 million pre-tax charge related to two interest rate swap contracts. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES In response to currency exchange rate movements during the quarter, the Company expanded certain of its risk management activities. Certain foreign subsidiaries increased transactional hedging activities performed locally to manage the exposure related to commercial transactions and intercompany receivables and payables. Generally, any change in the market value of the financial instrument is offset by a corresponding change in the hedged exposure. In addition, the Company purchased additional foreign currency put options as a hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on income. These contracts give the Company the right, but not the obligation, to sell foreign currencies, primarily European currencies and the yen, in exchange for U.S. dollars at predetermined exchange rates. Those purchased options that do not qualify for hedge accounting are carried on a current market value basis. RESTRUCTURING RESERVE STATUS In the year ending June 30, 1993, a pre-tax reserve of $2,402 million was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs.

This represents a 13% increase over the same quarter of the prior year, when net earnings were $792 million or $1.12 per share. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9,027 million, a 10% increase from the prior year's $8,177 million. The sales increase reflects record shipments and unit volume growth of 9%. The effects of stronger European and Asian currencies on both sales and earnings were offset by the weaker Mexican peso. Gross margin was 42.3% for the current quarter versus 43.3% for the first quarter of the Gross margin for the prior fiscal year was 41.5%. These margin trends reflect higher raw material costs, primarily pulp. Operating margin for the quarter improved to 15.9%, compared to 15.5% for the same quarter of the prior year, as continued focus on cost control largely offset the effects of higher raw material prices and increased research and development costs. Net sales for the North American region increased 7% on a 6% unit volume increase. Earnings for the region increased 8%, as cost control actions largely offset increased raw material prices, primarily pulp, and continued investment in the health care business. The unit volume gains were driven by the Food and Beverage business which contributed nearly half of the region's unit volume growth. Solid progress in all categories of the Paper business also contributed to the unit volume growth, although related earnings were negatively affected by higher pulp prices that were not fully recovered through pricing. The Laundry and Cleaning business contributed approximately 25% of the region's unit volume growth. Beauty Care unit volume achieved solid growth, driven by hair care. Health Care unit volume declined slightly due to softness in the respiratory Europe, Middle East and Africa First quarter sales for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased 16%. Unit volume was up 12%, led by gains in Eastern Europe. The region's earnings grew 20% over the same quarter last year. Favorable exchange rates added 6% to sales, more than offsetting product mix impacts. Broad-based unit volume gains across the region's businesses drove the earnings growth, complemented by continuing cost control actions. Asia maintained its strong growth rate with a 22% increase in unit volume, led by China. The region delivered 12% sales and 9% earnings growth over the same quarter of the prior year. Favorable exchange rates increased sales by 6%, helping to mitigate the effects of lower pricing and product mix. Double-digit unit volume growth was achieved by the region's key businesses, with Laundry and Cleaning continuing to lead the growth. The results of the region reflect the continuing investment in this fast-growing market. Latin America delivered unit volume growth of 6%, despite a 3% decline in Mexico. Sales for the region were down 4%, as favorable pricing helped lessen the effect of unfavorable exchange rates. Earnings for the region were down 7%, primarily due to the continuing effects of the Mexican Peso devaluation. Excluding Mexico, net earnings for the region increased over the same quarter of the prior year. Unit volume growth in the region was led by the Paper business, driven by the success of Pampers Uni. Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ending June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2,402 million was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs.

Operating margin for the quarter was 14.9%, an improvement over 14.2% for the same quarter of the prior year. The improvement reflects the effect of continued cost control efforts. Net sales and unit volume for the North American region grew 7% over the same quarter of the prior year. Earnings for the region increased 9%. The Laundry & Cleaning business led the region's growth, propelled by a significant unit volume increase. The Paper business also contributed to the unit volume growth, with particular strength in the tissue and towel and diaper categories. Margins continued to be affected by an increase in pulp prices over same quarter prior year. The Beauty Care and Food & Beverage businesses maintained strong unit volume growth, with double-digit growth in the hair care, coffee, juice and personal cleansing categories. The results of the Health Care business were affected by heavy competitive activity in the oral care and gastro-intestinal categories, which has hampered unit volume growth.

Second quarter sales for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased 11% over the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was led by a 7% unit volume growth, complemented by favorable pricing and exchange rates. Central and Eastern Europe achieved volume growth of over 50% with increased expansion into these markets, contributing nearly half of the region's unit volume growth. Net earnings for the region were up 26%, as incremental restructuring savings and on-going cost control benefits were realized. A simplification of trade terms has recently been announced, which could negatively affect growth trends in the short-term. This move to value pricing eliminates inefficient promotion costs by rolling them into lower list prices. When implemented in the United States, this change led to improved results. Europe experienced 9% unit volume growth for the July-December period with a 14% increase in sales. Net earnings increased 23% over the same period of the prior Asia achieved unit volume growth of 16%, led primarily by record shipments in China. Sales for the region increased 6%, with a 7% net earnings increase. Unfavorable exchange rates, lower pricing and product mix limited the sales and earnings growth relative to the increased unit volume. Laundry and Beauty Care continued to lead growth within the region, experiencing double-digit volume For the first six months of the fiscal year, Asia had a 19% increase in unit volume and 9% sales growth. Net earnings increased by 8% over the prior period. Despite continuing economic difficulties in Latin America, the region delivered 8% unit volume growth in the quarter. Exchange effects, combined with higher costs, resulted in a sales and net earnings decline of 4% and 1%, respectively. Significant unit volume growth in Brazil and Venezuela compensated for flat unit volume in Mexico. Excluding Mexico, net earnings for the region increased For the July-December period, unit volume for the region grew 7%. Sales and net earnings both declined 4% from the prior year period. RESTRUCTURING RESERVE STATUS In the year ending June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2,402 million was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separation-related costs (86% of the total). The following information relates to the June 1993 reserve (in millions of Original Balance July-Dec. Balance Includes separation allowances and related benefits, out placement services, and personnel relocation costs. Includes closing, environmental remediation and contract termination costs for sites shut down or divested, offset by proceeds from asset sales. No cost element within this category exceeds 5% of the total Execution of the restructuring program continues to be on track, and the cost of completing it is expected to approximate the original estimates. As anticipated, charges for the disposal of fixed assets will lag behind spending for separation-related programs. Over 80% of the sites and production modules to be closed have been announced in order to provide advance notice to employees. Benefits continue to be obtained from the restructuring program. Incremental savings of approximately $25 million after-tax are estimated for the October-December quarter, bringing cumulative restructuring savings near the $500 million after-tax objective established in June 1993. Based on current projections, the Company believes cumulative restructuring savings ultimately may exceed the original estimate by approximately 20%. Restructuring savings are estimated gross savings, which have been offset to some degree by lower pricing and other actions to build the business. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",929
1996-05-10,10-Q,0000080424-96-000006,"Worldwide Results of Operations Worldwide net earnings for the quarter ending March 31, 1996 were $760 million, a 20% increase over the same quarter of the prior year net earnings of $631 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07 compared to $0.88 in the third quarter of the prior year, a 22% increase. Net earnings for the same quarter of the prior year included a $50 million charge related to the earthquake in Kobe, Japan. Excluding that charge, quarterly net earnings and earnings per share increased 12% and 13%, respectively. Worldwide third quarter net sales were $8.59 billion for the quarter, a 3% increase over the same quarter of the prior year, on comparable unit volume Gross margin was 41.5% for the current quarter versus 41.2% for the same quarter of the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, an improvement over 12.8% for the same quarter of the prior year. The improvement reflects continued efforts to improve efficiencies and simplify operations, resulting in lower costs to complement unit volume growth. For the nine months ended March 31, 1996, worldwide net earnings were $2.49 billion or $3.52 per share, an increase of 15% over the same period of the prior year. Worldwide net sales fiscal year-to-date increased 7% to $26.70 billion, on comparable unit volume growth. North America achieved 4% unit volume growth and 6% sales growth for the quarter versus a strong year-ago period. Positive pricing impacts and lower costs drove the region's 19% net earnings growth. The Laundry and Cleaning segment led the region's unit volume growth, with progress across substantially all categories. The Paper business achieved particularly strong net earnings results on important unit volume growth, with the diaper and feminine protection categories contributing double-digit unit volume increases. Food and Beverage contributed to the earnings growth with moderate volume increases and reduced green coffee bean prices. Despite flat volume, earnings in Beauty Care increased as a result of product mix and cost control efforts. The regional Health Care business was negatively impacted by competitive activity in the OTC health care categories, resulting in the segment's year-to-year decline in sales and net earnings. For the July-March period, the North America region increased sales 7%, on unit volume growth of 6%. Net earnings improved 12% over the prior year period. Third quarter unit volume for Europe, Middle East and Africa was flat, primarily due to the transition to value pricing in key Western European markets. This strategy to deliver better value to consumers was introduced several years ago in the United States and improved long-term results. Developing markets like Eastern Europe continued to generate excellent unit volume growth versus the same period of the prior year. The region's sales and earnings were at about the same level as the prior year due to the combined effects of pricing and a strong For the July-March period, unit volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 6%, which, when combined with favorable exchange rates, drove 9% sales growth. Excellent cost reduction results helped the region achieve 15% net earnings growth for the nine months to date. Asia unit volume growth in the quarter remained strong, up 16% over the same period of the prior year. Sales growth was 4%, due primarily to lower pricing and unfavorable exchange rates in Japan. Exchange rates contributed a 5% decline across the region. Quarterly net earnings increased 11%, reflecting favorable mix effects and improved costs on certain key brands. China and the Philippines led the region with double-digit unit volume increases and improved earnings For the nine months ended March 31, 1996, Asia unit volume grew 18%, with a sales increase of 7%. Net earnings increased by 9% over the prior year. Unit volume for the Latin America region declined 5% in the quarter, as strong unit volume results in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela were offset by market softening and an unusually strong year ago comparison in Mexico. Unfavorable exchange rate movements in the region contributed to a sales and net earnings decline of 4% for the quarter, despite continued cost control efforts in the For the July-March period, unit volume grew 3% in the Latin America region. Sales and net earnings were down 4%, as unfavorable exchange rates and the impact of the recession in Mexico affected results. Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ending June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2.40 billion was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs.

1996-11-13,10-Q,0000080424-96-000043,"and Analysis Results of Operations -- First Quarter Fiscal 1997 Compared with First Quarter Worldwide net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 were $979 million or $1.39 per share. This represents a 9% increase over prior year first quarter earnings of $896 million or $1.27 per share. Sales for the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 1% compared to prior year first quarter sales of $9.0 billion. Worldwide unit volume grew 1% from the first quarter a year ago. The difference between the sales and unit volume trends was largely due to weaker currencies. Excluding the effect of unfavorable exchange rates, particularly in Japan and Germany, sales increased consistent with unit The company's results were affected by competitive pressures in Japan and difficult economic conditions in Latin America. In addition, the further roll-out of the Efficient Consumer Response program (ECR) within Europe and Asia impacted results. Specifically, the initial roll-out resulted in a reduction of trade inventories, slowing growth in the affected markets. When implemented several years ago in the United States, this program resulted in negative short-term business effects, but yielded stronger consumer loyalty and improved profit margins longer term. Gross margin was 43.8% for the current quarter, compared to 42.3% in the first quarter of the prior year and 41.2% for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1996. Operating margin was 17.4% compared with 15.9% in the prior first quarter and 13.6% for the prior fiscal year, reflecting continued improvement in gross margin, efforts to improve efficiencies, and simplify operations, resulting in Net sales for the North America region increased 1% compared with the same quarter a year ago, on a 2% unit volume increase. The sales and volume growth in the quarter was affected by capacity constraints on certain key categories, such as tissue and towel. Earnings for the region grew 9%, reflecting broad-based margin growth from improved pricing and costs. The region's unit volume growth was led by the laundry and cleaning business, with particularly strong growth in the laundry and fabric conditioners categories. The paper business increased unit volume over a strong base period, despite capacity constraints in the tissue and towel category, where volume declined slightly due to reduced merchandising efforts pending planned capacity additions. This impact was offset primarily by the effect of acquisitions, as well as growth in the diapers and feminine hygiene categories. Importantly, earnings in this business led the region's growth, with improved pricing actions. The beauty care business also increased unit volume on the strength of the hair care category, as well as excellent growth in deodorants. Food and beverage increased unit volume, when adjusted for the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, as strength in the peanut butter and snack categories was moderated by softness in baking mixes and shortening and oils. Unit volume in the health care business was about flat, excluding the prior year divestiture of the Company's share of a joint venture. Oral care volume was up, but the effect was more than offset by the decline in respiratory care volume. The health care business also impacted the region's earnings growth, reflecting the volume softness in certain categories, as well as the increased investment to reestablish oral care growth. Europe, Middle East and Africa Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa declined 1%, as unfavorable exchange rates, which reduced sales by 2%, combined with lower pricing related to ECR. Unit volume increased 5%, to a new record level. Net earnings increased 13% over the first quarter of last year, reflecting the solid volume progress and the margin improvement impact of lower costs. Central and Eastern Europe led the region's unit volume growth, increasing shipments by nearly 50%, primarily on the strength of the laundry and cleaning business. The Middle East and Africa region also had double-digit unit volume growth, while the remainder of the region was fairly flat, due to the impacts of First quarter results of the Asia region were impacted by the competitive environment in Japan and exchange rate effects. Sales declined 14%, including 9% related to unfavorable exchange rate movements. Unit volume was down 9%, largely due to the Japan situation and the impact of ECR-related trade inventory reductions. Additionally, China's unit volume growth was below recent levels, as trade inventories were adjusted in response to price increases taken earlier in the quarter. The Company's market share position remains strong, and unit volume in China is expected to rebound in the second quarter. Net earnings in Asia were down 10%, consistent with the sales trend in region. Sales in Latin America were down 1% in the first quarter, as pricing policies designed to address inflation and devaluation trends helped offset volume softness. Unit volume in the quarter was down 6%, reflecting declining markets due to slow economic recovery in key markets. Net earnings increased 11% on improved margins, largely reflecting the pricing actions. RESTRUCTURING RESERVE STATUS In the year ended June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2.4 billion was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separations. The balance of the reserve at September 30, 1996 was $610 million, with approximately half of the balance representing planned fixed asset disposals, all of which have been announced. The restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed during the current fiscal year. Based on current management estimates, the cost of the program is expected to approximate the original estimate, although certain immaterial reclassifications have been made within the elements of the reserve.

1997-02-11,10-Q,0000080424-97-000006,"and Analysis Worldwide net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 1997 were $944 million, a 13% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35 per share, a 14% increase over the same quarter of last year. The difference between the net earnings and earnings per share increases was primarily due to the company's stock repurchase program. Net sales for the quarter were $9.14 billion, up 1% compared to prior year second quarter sales of $9.09 billion. Worldwide unit volume grew 2% from the second quarter a year ago. The difference between the sales and unit volume trends was largely due to weaker currencies in Europe and Asia, primarily For the first six months of the fiscal year, worldwide net earnings were $1.92 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year. Earnings per share were $2.74 per share, a 12% increase over the prior year. Worldwide unit volume for the first six months was up 2% over the prior year, while net sales were stable, primarily reflecting unfavorable exchange rates. The company's results were impacted by competitive pressures in Japan and difficult economic conditions in Latin America. In addition, the continued roll-out of the Efficient Consumer Response program (ECR) within Europe and Asia has impacted results. Specifically, as ECR is rolled out in new markets, trade inventories are reduced, which negatively impacts short-term growth rate trends. When implemented several years ago in the United States, this program resulted in negative short-term business effects, but yielded stronger consumer loyalty and improved profit margins longer term. Gross margin was 44.6% for the current quarter, compared to 42.1% in the second quarter of the prior year and 41.2% for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1996. The key driver of the gross margin improvement has been lower commodity prices, primarily pulp which declined in the latter part of the prior year, and cost reduction programs throughout the company. Operating margin was 16.6% compared to 14.9% in the prior second quarter and 13.6% for the prior fiscal year, reflecting the higher gross margins, partially offset by increased costs related to marketing, research and administrative activities. Net sales for the North America region increased 3% compared with the same quarter a year ago, on a 5% unit volume increase. The net sales and unit volume progress was achieved despite capacity constraints in certain key categories, particularly tissue and towel. Net earnings for the region increased 15%, benefiting from lower commodity prices and cost reductions. The region's volume growth was led by the laundry and cleaning business, specifically, strong growth in the laundry and fabric softener categories. Food and beverage also posted strong volume growth on the strength of the snacks category, which is benefiting from increased capacity, and the coffee category. The paper business also increased total unit volume, despite continued capacity constraints in the tissue and towel categories, due to growth generated from feminine hygiene products. The paper business led the region's earnings growth, primarily due to lower pulp prices, which declined in the latter part of the prior year. Beauty Care increased volumes, led by strong growth in the hair care and deodorants categories. Excluding the impacts of the prior year divestiture of the Company's share of a joint venture, unit volume in the health care business increased modestly due to increased volume in oral care. Importantly, despite the modest unit volume growth, health care's earnings showed significant improvement due to increased licensing activity. For the first six months of the fiscal year, the North American region had net sales and unit volume growth of 2% and 3%, respectively. Net earnings increased 12% over the same period in the prior year. Europe, Middle East and Africa Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa for the second quarter were stable, as unfavorable exchange rates and lower pricing offset a 4% increase in volume. Net earnings for the quarter grew 24% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting the margin improvement impact of lower costs, led by pulp. Central and Eastern Europe led the region's volume growth, increasing shipments by nearly 40%, with strong gains in most core segments. Middle East and Africa also had double-digit volume growth. Western Europe's unit volume declined For the July-December period, the region's net sales declined 1%. Unit volume and net earnings increased 4% and 17% respectively, for the same period. Second quarter operations in Asia continue to be impacted by the competitive environment in Japan, the impact of the ECR roll-out and exchange rate effects. Sales for the region declined 8% compared to the same quarter of the prior year on a unit volume decline of 7%. Importantly, China's unit volume growth improved over the first quarter. A 5% decline in the region's sales attributable to unfavorable exchange rates was offset by more favorable pricing. Net earnings in Asia for the second quarter increased 12% on improved margins. Net sales and unit volume for the July-December period declined 10% and 8%, respectively. Net earnings increased 2% over the same period in the prior year. Net sales in Latin America increased 3% in the second quarter, despite a 3% decline in volume, due to pricing designed to address inflation and devaluation, particularly in Mexico. The unit volume decline was caused by the continued economic difficulties and slow economic recovery in certain key markets. Net earnings for the region increased 35% on improved margins, reflecting both pricing and cost reductions from standardization and simplification efforts. For the July-December period, net sales and net earnings were up 1% and 24%, respectively. Unit volume was down 5% compared to the same period in the prior Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ended June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2.4 billion was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separations. The balance of the reserve at December 31, 1996 was approximately $490 million, with approximately half of the balance representing planned fixed asset disposals, all of which have been announced. The restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed during the current fiscal year.

1997-05-09,10-Q,0000080424-97-000023,"Worldwide net earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 1997 were $881 million, a 16% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.26, an 18% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. The difference between the net earnings and earnings per share increases was primarily due to the company's share repurchase program. Net sales for the quarter were $8.77 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year third quarter sales of $8.59 billion. Worldwide unit volume grew 4% from the third quarter a year ago. Weaker currencies in Europe, Asia and Latin America negatively impacted sales, causing the difference between sales and volume In the first nine months of the fiscal year, worldwide net earnings were $2.80 billion, a 13% increase compared to the same prior year period. Year-to-date earnings per share were $4.00 per share, a 14% increase over the prior year. Worldwide unit volume for the first nine months was up 2% over the prior year, while sales were relatively stable at $26.8 billion, primarily reflecting unfavorable exchange rates. Gross margin was 43.9% for the current quarter, compared to 41.5% in the third quarter of the prior year and 41.2% for the full fiscal year ended June 30,1996. The key driver of the margin improvement has been cost reduction programs throughout the company and lower commodity prices, primarily pulp. Operating margin was 15.8% for the current quarter, an improvement over the 13.9% operating margin in the prior year third quarter and 13.6% for the prior fiscal year. This improvement was a reflection of higher gross margins, partially offset by increased costs related to marketing, research and administrative Net sales for the North America region remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter a year ago, on a 2% unit volume increase. The difference between sales and volume growth rates is primarily a reflection of lower pricing in the laundry category and commodity-based price reductions in the paper categories. Third quarter net earnings for the region increased 6% (compared to the same prior year period), as the region continued to benefit from simplification and standardization cost savings. The region's unit volume growth was led by the laundry, fabric conditioners and snacks categories. Importantly, laundry achieved volume growth over a very strong year ago base period and snacks continued to achieve double digit unit volume growth, benefitting from new production capacity. The paper business also increased unit volume led by strong growth in the feminine protection category and the Scott Baby Fresh acquisition in the diaper/wipes category. Beauty care volume declined in the current quarter due to softness in the hair care category, primarily reflecting trade inventory adjustments. Excluding the impacts of the prior year period divestiture of the Company's share of a joint venture, unit volume in the health care business improved over prior year period due to increased respiratory care volume. Health care's earnings also showed strong improvement due to increased licensing activity. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, the North American region had net sales and unit volume growth of 1% and 3%, respectively. Year to date net earnings increased 10% over the prior year. Europe, Middle East and Africa Third quarter net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter, as unit volume growth of 9% was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Net earnings for the quarter grew 20% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting volume gains and cost savings as the region begins to benefit from Efficient Consumer Response (ECR). Central and Eastern Europe led the region's volume growth, increasing shipments by over 45%. The Middle East and Africa also had double digit increases. Market share for these two geographies continues to build across most core categories. Importantly, Western Europe, led by Germany, showed volume improvement over the comparable prior year period in which the Company began its transition to ECR. For the July-March period, the region's net sales remained stable on unit volume growth of 6%, reflecting unfavorable exchange rates and lower pricing. Year to date net earnings increased 18% over prior year. Asia continued to be impacted by the transition to ECR and competitive pressures in Japan. Third quarter sales for the region increased 1% over the same prior year period, as improved pricing and product mix offset continued softness in Japan and the impact of unfavorable exchange rates. Unit volume growth declined by 1% during the quarter, with the negative impacts of Japan largely offset by the acceleration of unit volume growth rates in the Philippines and the continued growth in China. Net earnings for the quarter grew by 37%, driven primarily by pricing actions and improved product mix. Net sales and unit volume for the July-March period declined 7% and 6%, respectively. Year-to-date net earnings for the period were up 12%. Net sales for the third quarter in Latin America grew 12% compared to the prior year quarter, on unit volume growth of 1%, as pricing designed to address inflation and devaluation was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. The region continues to be impacted by economic difficulties in certain key markets, as acquisitions in the laundry category were largely responsible for the unit volume increase. Net earnings for the quarter increased 53% on improved margins, primarily reflecting pricing, as well as the impact of divestitures of certain non-strategic brands. For the July-March period, net sales and net earnings were up 5% and 33%, respectively. The region's year-to-date unit volume was down 3% for the first Restructuring Reserve Status In the year ended June 30, 1993, a reserve of $2.4 billion was established to cover a worldwide restructuring effort to consolidate manufacturing systems and reduce overhead costs. The primary elements of this reserve were costs related to fixed asset disposals and separations. The balance of the reserve at March 31, 1997 was approximately $380 million, with approximately half of the balance representing planned fixed asset disposals, all of which have been announced. The restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed during the current fiscal year. Based on current management estimates, the cost of the program is expected to approximate the original estimate. In April 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Tambrands, Inc., a company in the feminine hygiene category, for approximately $2 billion. The acquisition is subject to approval by the shareholders of Tambrands, Inc., and regulatory clearance. It is expected to close in fiscal 1998. Pending Accounting Pronouncements In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128, ""Earnings Per Share"", which revises the manner in which earnings per share is calculated. The statement is effective for our reporting period ending December 31, 1997 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's earnings per share. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",1146

1997-11-14,10-Q,0000080424-97-000075,"and Analysis RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 1997 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER Net earnings for the July-September quarter were $ .79 per share, a 13 percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Worldwide net earnings for the quarter were $1,085 million, an 11 percent increase. The differential between the earnings per share and net earnings increases was primarily due to the company's stock repurchase program. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9.4 billion, a five percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year, on eight percent unit volume growth. The difference between the sales and volume growth rates was largely due to weaker currencies in Western Europe and Asia. Net acquisitions and divestitures, led by the July 1997 addition of Tambrands, contributed one percent to the unit The Company's ongoing program of simplification and standardization did not have a significant impact on earnings in the current quarter. This program includes re-engineering of the manufacturing and distribution processes, organization design projects, consolidation of selected manufacturing facilities, simplified product line-ups and sales of non-strategic brands. Gross margin was 44.3 percent for the quarter compared to 43.3 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 42.7 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. The key driver of the margin improvement has been a continuation of the effective focus on cost control through simplification and standardization efforts throughout the company. Operating margin was 18.6 percent for the quarter compared to 17.4 percent in the same quarter year ago and 15.3 percent for the prior fiscal year. This improvement was a reflection of the higher volumes and gross margins, partially offset by higher costs related to marketing, research, and administrative activities. Net sales for the North America region were up six percent, on equal volume growth. Net earnings grew five percent as the impact of volume growth was partially offset by increased spending on new product initiatives and provisions for simplification and standardization projects. The region's six percent unit volume growth was broad based with contributions from all segments and was led by the laundry, tissue and towel, and snacks categories. The tissue and towel and snacks growth was achieved behind increases in productive capacity. The laundry category continued strong shipments behind product initiatives. Feminine protection also achieved significant growth driven primarily by the acquired Tambrands business. Unit volume growth within the Beauty Care segment was achieved behind new product initiatives in hair care and deodorants. Health Care achieved unit volume increase in both over the counter medicines and pharmaceuticals, while continuing to invest in new brand EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA Net sales in Europe, Middle East, and Africa were flat on a 10 percent unit volume increase, as the favorable impact of volume growth was offset by unfavorable exchange rates, primarily in Germany, France and Italy. The region's net earnings grew six percent as the favorable impacts of volume and higher gross margins were partially offset by higher new brand initiative spending and unfavorable exchange rates. The region's unit volume growth was led by continued double digit growth in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. Western Europe also achieved solid unit volume growth led by continued growth in laundry and the Net sales in Asia grew four percent for the quarter on unit volume growth of eight percent, as pricing actions in China and other southeast Asia countries were offset by weaker currencies throughout the region. The region's net earnings increased 35 percent as the favorable impacts of volume growth and pricing were partially offset by increased spending on product initiatives and unfavorable exchange rates. Asia unit volume growth was led by double digit growth in China, the Philippines and Indonesia. Importantly, Japan's volume increased behind new brand initiatives, despite the continuing weakness in consumer demand in the overall market. Net sales in Latin America were up 15 percent driven by improved pricing in key countries. Net earnings increased 112 percent, which included the gain on the sale of a non-strategic brand. Unit volume for the region was up four percent, driven by double digit gains in Brazil, which benefited from an acquisition in the laundry category, and Venezuela. Mexico's unit volume was down, primarily due to the divestiture of the non-strategic brand. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 2. Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds: (a) On October 15, 1997, the Company amended its Amended Articles of Incorporation (see 8-K filed October 15, 1997) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 2,000,000,000 to 5,000,000,000. (b) On October 15, 1997, the Company amended its Amended Articles of Incorporation to change the dividend rate for its Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock (the ""Series A Preferred Stock""), so that such dividend rate would equal the higher of the existing dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock or the then current dividend on the Company's Common Stock. This change will result in the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock gradually into shares of Common Stock, rather than being converted all at once at such time as the dividend rate on the Common Stock exceeds the dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock. A corresponding change was made to the dividend rate on the Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.",891

1998-02-13,10-Q,0000080424-98-000008,"and Analysis Basic net earnings for the October-December quarter of fiscal year 1998 were $.76 per share, a 13 percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Worldwide net earnings for the quarter were $1,046 million, an 11 percent increase. The differential between the earnings per share and net earnings increases was primarily due to the company's stock repurchase program. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9.6 billion, a five percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year, on eight percent unit volume growth. Acquisitions, primarily Tambrands, net of divestitures, contributed two percent to the unit volume growth rate. The difference between the sales and volume growth rates was largely due to weaker currencies in Asia and western Europe. Basic earnings per share for the first six months of the fiscal year were $1.55, a 13 percent increase over the prior year. Worldwide net earnings were $2,133 million, an 11 percent increase over the prior year. Worldwide net sales for the first six months were $19.0 billion, up five percent over the prior year, on eight percent unit volume growth. Unfavorable exchange rates caused the difference between sales and volume growth rates. Gross margin was 44.8 percent for the current quarter compared to 44.3 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 42.7 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. The key driver of the margin improvement has been a continuation of the effective focus on cost control through simplification and standardization efforts throughout the company. Operating margin was 17.5 percent for the current quarter compared to 16.6 percent in the same quarter year ago and 15.3 percent for the prior fiscal year. This improvement was a reflection of the higher gross margins and lower administrative and other costs relative to sales, partially offset by higher marketing and research costs. Second quarter net sales for the North America region were up seven percent versus the same quarter of the prior year, on six percent volume growth. Net earnings grew 15 percent behind volume growth and continued savings from simplification and standardization projects partially reduced by increased investment in product initiatives. The region's six percent unit volume growth was led by the Paper, Food and Beverage, and Laundry and Cleaning segments. The growth was driven primarily by feminine protection, which benefited from the Tambrands acquisition, and by tissue and towel and snacks, which benefited from increases in production capacity. The laundry category continued strong shipments behind product initiatives. Unit volume growth within the Beauty Care segment was achieved behind new product initiatives in hair care and deodorants. Health Care unit volume was down due to competitive pressure in oral care. For the first six months of the fiscal year, net sales for the North America region were up six percent on equal unit volume growth. Net earnings increased nine percent over the same period in the prior year, and included the impact of provisions for simplification and standardization projects in the first quarter. EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA Second quarter net sales in Europe, Middle East, and Africa were up four percent on a 12 percent unit volume increase, as the favorable impact of volume growth was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates across Europe. The region's net earnings grew 17 percent as the favorable impacts of volume and higher gross margins were partially offset by higher new brand initiative spending and unfavorable exchange rates. The region's unit volume growth was led by continued double digit growth in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. Western Europe also achieved solid unit volume growth led by continued strength in laundry and the For the first six months of the fiscal year, the region's net sales and unit volume grew two percent and 11 percent respectively. Net earnings increased 11 percent over the same period in the prior year. Asia unit volume for the second quarter was flat due to market contraction caused by economic troubles which have impacted most Asian countries. Net sales were down five percent versus the same quarter year ago, with the impact of weaker currencies across the region partially offset by price increases. The region's net earnings were down four percent due to unfavorable exchange rates and higher investment in product initiatives. On a year to date basis, sales were down one percent while unit volume increased four percent. Net earnings increased 12 percent reflecting the favorable impact of volume growth and pricing partially offset by product initiative spending and unfavorable exchange rates. Earnings in Asia over the balance of the current fiscal year are expected to be well below year ago as the full effect of the economic crisis in that region is felt. However, this is not expected to be significant to the Company's overall earnings growth rate for the current fiscal year. While the region is expected to recover from these difficulties, the depth and duration of the economic effects are still uncertain. Net sales in Latin America were up 18 percent for the quarter on 15 percent volume growth. Net earnings increased 10 percent, with the favorable impact of volume growth partially offset by increased marketing support to counter competitive pressure in Brazil. Unit volume growth for the region was broad based with almost all countries recording increases. Mexico led this growth behind the acquisition of a paper business and volume growth in the base business. Brazil benefited from prior year acquisitions in the laundry category. On a year to date basis, sales increased 17 percent with unit volume up 10 percent. Net earnings increased 53 percent, benefiting from the first quarter sale of a non-strategic brand.

Operating margin was 17.1 percent for the quarter compared to 15.8 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 15.3 percent for the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating margin reflected the reduction of manufacturing expenses, partially offset by higher selling, research and administrative expenses. The Company's ongoing program of simplification and standardization did not have a significant impact on operating margin, since gains on sales of non-strategic brands were reinvested in other projects. Gross margin was 41.1 percent for the current quarter compared to 43.2 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 42.7 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. Gross margin was negatively impacted this quarter by provisions for shutdown costs of a laundry site, a pulp mill, and other simplification and standardization projects, partially offset by lower Net sales in North America were up two percent versus the same quarter in the prior year on one percent unit volume growth. Net sales growth outpaced volume due to pricing. The region achieved a 10 percent net earnings increase due to pricing and lower costs. A $200 million after tax gain on the sale of the Duncan Hines business was reinvested in simplification and standardization projects, including the closing of a laundry plant, a pulp mill, and other The region's unit volume softness was caused by a number of factors, most notably pricing, as competition has lagged behind the Company in the implementation of price increases in tissue and towel and laundry. In addition, the growth rate in snacks was reduced due to competitive pressure. Volume softness in these categories and the impact of the sale of the Duncan Hines business were partially offset by volume strength in beauty care, led by hair care and deodorants, feminine protection, which benefited from the Tambrands acquisition, and pharmaceuticals.

Net earnings grew 36 percent behind volume gains, higher gross margins, and the sale of minor brands. Unit volume growth in the region was led by continued double digit growth in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa.

Worldwide net earnings for the quarter were $1.17 billion, a seven percent increase. The difference between the earnings per share and the net earnings increases was primarily due to the Company's share repurchase program. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9.5 billion, a two percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Weaker currencies, primarily in Asia and Latin America, reduced sales by three percent. Unit volume was flat, with the difference in sales and volume growth caused primarily by price increases and favorable product mix. Gross margin was 45.5 percent for the current quarter compared to 44.3 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 43.3 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Gross margin was positively impacted this quarter by improved pricing, product mix, and lower manufacturing expenses. Operating margin was 19.7 percent for the quarter compared to 18.6 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.3 percent for the prior fiscal year, largely reflecting the improvement in gross margin. Net sales in North America were up one percent versus the same quarter in the prior year on a one percent unit volume decline. Sales growth was driven by improved pricing in laundry and cleaning and paper products. The region achieved an 11 percent net earnings increase due primarily to improved pricing in laundry and paper products. The decline in volume was due to the prior year divestiture of Duncan Hines and increased competition in the hair care and oral care markets. Importantly, the laundry & cleaning business benefited from strength in fabric care behind the launch of Febreze, and the paper business achieved gains behind growth in diapers. In addition, excluding the impact of the divestiture of Duncan Hines, food & beverage unit volume grew behind a broad recovery in coffee driven by EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA Net sales for Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased four percent on a two percent decline in unit volume.

The region's net earnings grew eight percent, primarily behind pricing-driven improvements in gross margins and cost The region's unit volume was negatively impacted by Central and Eastern Europe, as a result of the economic crisis in Russia. Volumes were also soft in laundry & cleaning, due to increased competitive initiatives. Food & beverage achieved strong volume gains behind the strength of Pringles in Western Europe and the launch of Sunny Delight in the United Kingdom. The paper products business was up slightly behind continued growth in Bounty and Baby Wipes. Net sales in Asia fell seven percent versus the same quarter of the prior year, on two percent unit volume growth, due to the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. Net earnings increased 11 percent versus the same quarter last year, as improved pricing, cost reduction and the favorable settlement of a patent litigation dispute offset the continuing impact of economic difficulties in the The region grew volume behind the prior year acquisition of the Ssangyong Paper Company in Korea and improvement in the base business in Japan, which advanced despite the country's economic difficulties, and increased market share behind product initiatives, primarily in beauty care and laundry and cleaning. Volume continues to be ngatively impacted by the recession and lower consumption in Latin America net sales were up 13 percent, on 15 percent unit volume growth, as increased pricing largely offset the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. Earnings for the region were up 21 percent, reflecting effective balance sheet management in the face of the peso devaluation in Mexico Unit volume growth for the quarter was led by Mexico, which benefited from the prior year acquisition of the Loreto y Pena paper business and growth in its base business. Importantly, the region's laundry and cleaning business strengthened behind accelerated product innovation. Total debt increased $1.6 billion since June 30, 1998. The incremental debt was used to finance working capital, ongoing operations and the previously announced accelerated share repurchase program. In September, 1998, the Company announced plans for Organization 2005, a realignment of the organizational structure, work processes, and culture to accelerate growth and innovation. Details regarding the nature, timing, and implications related to the design change are currently being determined. Financial impacts are not yet known. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",752
1999-02-05,10-Q,0000080424-99-000002,"and Analysis Basic net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 1998 were $ .84 per share, an 11 percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Worldwide net earnings for the quarter were $1.14 billion, a nine percent increase. The difference between the earnings per share and the net earnings increases was primarily due to the Company's share repurchase program. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9.9 billion, a three percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Weaker currencies, primarily in Asia and Latin America, reduced sales by one percent. Unit volume was flat, with the difference in sales and volume growth caused by favorable pricing and mix Basic net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 1998 were $1.70 per share, a 10 percent increase versus a year ago. Net earnings for the same period were $2.31 billion, an eight percent increase over the prior year. Worldwide sales for the six-month period grew two percent to $19.4 billion, ahead of flat unit volume, due largely to favorable pricing impacts. Unfavorable exchange rates reduced sales by two percent year-to-date. Gross margin was 45.9 percent for the quarter ended December 31, 1998 compared to 44.8 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 43.3 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Gross margin was positively impacted this quarter by improved pricing, product mix, and lower manufacturing expenses. Operating margin was 18.5 percent for the quarter compared to 17.5 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.3 percent for the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating margin reflected pricing-driven improvements in gross margin, which were partially offset by higher marketing, research and administrative expenditures behind product innovations, and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates. Net sales in North America for the quarter ended December 31, 1998 were up two percent versus the same quarter in the prior year on a one percent unit volume increase. Sales growth was primarily driven by improved pricing in Laundry and Cleaning, Beauty Care, and Paper. The region achieved a 12 percent net earnings increase due primarily to pricing and cost improvements. The pace of the business in North America is improving, with volume up three percent excluding the sale of Duncan Hines. The Region's overall unit volume improvement was driven by Laundry and Cleaning, which enjoyed continued success from improved market shares across all laundry brands and from the launch of Febreze in the fabric care category, and Paper, behind additional tissue capacity. In addition, strong coffee results partially offset unit volume losses resulting from the prior year divestiture of Duncan Hines in the Food and For the six months ended December 31, 1998, net sales were up two percent on flat unit volume. Net earnings increased 12 percent. EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA Net sales for Europe, Middle East, and Africa for the three months ended December 31, 1998 increased three percent over the same quarter in the prior year on a four percent decline in unit volume. Sales outpaced volume behind improved pricing, primarily in laundry and paper products, and favorable exchange effects in Western Europe. The Region's results were negatively impacted by the economic crisis and currency devaluation in Russia. Despite the impact of Russia and Central and Eastern Europe, the Region's net earnings grew 12 percent, primarily behind improved pricing. Volume softness was largely attributable to the economic crisis in Russia and continued competitive pressures in laundry & cleaning, primarily related to laundry tablet initiatives in Western Europe. However, a number of new brand expansions in the Region are beginning to produce positive results. Food & beverage achieved considerable volume gains behind the strength of Pringles, as well as the successful launch of Sunny Delight in the United Kingdom. In paper, Bounty continues to exceed objectives in Germany and has now assumed market For the six months ended December 31, 1998, sales were up three percent while unit volume declined three percent. Net earnings increased 10 percent. Net sales in Asia for the three months ended December 31, 1998 increased five percent versus the same quarter of the prior year, on five percent unit volume growth, as positive pricing offset the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. Net earnings increased two percent versus the same quarter last year, as sales increases were partially offset by increased investment in new initiatives and economic conditions in the ASEAN region. The region grew volume behind the strengthening of the business in Japan and China and the prior year acquisition of the Ssangyong Paper Company in Korea. Importantly, Japan was able to build market share in a difficult economy through laundry and cleaning initiatives and Pringles. China's unit volume grew behind the national expansion of Vidal Sassoon, improved Whisper Ultra, and advance buying in anticipation of a consumption tax increase. Volume in the remainder of Asia continues to be negatively impacted by the recession and market For the six months ended December 31, 1998, sales decreased one percent and unit volume increased four percent. Sales did not keep pace with unit volume growth due to the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. Net earnings increased seven Latin America net sales for the three months ended December 31, 1998 were up seven percent versus the same quarter of the prior year, on five percent unit volume growth, as improved pricing more than offset the effects of unfavorable exchange rates. Earnings for the Region were up nine percent, as the improvement in sales and pricing exceeded the investment in product upgrades and new Unit volume growth for the quarter was led by the strengthening of the business in Mexico and the prior year buy-out of a paper joint venture in Chile and For the six months ended December 31, 1998, sales increased 10 percent on a nine percent increase in unit volume. Net earnings increased 14 percent. Total debt increased $1.3 billion since June 30, 1998. The incremental debt was used primarily to finance the previously announced share repurchase program. As outlined in the 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1998, the Company has developed plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the Year 2000. These plans have not changed materially in terms of scope or estimated costs to complete, and are progressing according to previously identified time schedules. Implementation of required changes to critical systems is expected to be completed during fiscal 1999.

Worldwide net earnings for the quarter were $1.04 billion, an eight percent increase. The difference between the earnings per share and the net earnings increases was primarily due to the Company's share repurchase program. Worldwide net sales for the quarter were $9.2 billion, a four percent increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Unit volume was flat, with the difference in sales and volume growth caused by premium-priced initiatives and Basic net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 1999 were $2.46 per share, a 10 percent increase versus a year ago. Net earnings for the same period were $3.35 billion, an eight percent increase over the prior year. Worldwide sales for the nine-month period grew three percent to $28.7 billion, ahead of flat unit volume, due largely to favorable pricing impacts. Unfavorable exchange rates reduced sales by two percent year-to-date. Gross margin was 46.4 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 1999 compared to 41.1 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 43.3 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Gross margin was positively impacted this quarter by improved pricing, product mix, and lower manufacturing expenses. In addition, the year ago quarter's gross margin was negatively impacted by provisions for shutdown costs of a laundry site, a pulp mill, and other simplification and standardization projects. Operating margin was 18.0 percent for the quarter compared to 17.1 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.3 percent for the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating margin reflected improvements in gross margin, partially offset by higher marketing, research and administrative expenditures behind product innovations. Net sales in North America for the quarter ended March 31, 1999 increased seven percent versus the same quarter in the prior year, outpacing a five percent unit volume growth, primarily as a result of the successful launches of premium-priced initiatives in paper and beauty care and improved pricing in the paper and laundry and cleaning businesses. The region's net earnings were up 16 percent due primarily to increased unit volume, pricing, and effective control of manufacturing costs, partially offset by increased investment in initiatives. The business in North America continues to strengthen, with volume up six percent excluding the sale of Duncan Hines. The region's overall unit volume growth was driven by the laundry and cleaning business, behind the continued success of the launch of Febreze, the recent launch of Tide with Bleach that sanitizes laundry and share growth behind Cascade Plus. Shares are also growing in fabric conditioners behind new initiatives. In addition, the Oil of Olay Cosmetics and Rash-Guard Diaper initiatives are contributing to stronger volumes in the beauty care and paper businesses. For the nine months ended March 31, 1999, net sales were up three percent on a two percent improvement in unit volume. Net earnings increased 13 percent. EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA Net sales for Europe, Middle East, and Africa for the three months ended March 31, 1999, were flat versus the same quarter of the prior year, on a five percent decline in unit volume, as the region's results continue to be negatively impacted by the economic crisis and currency devaluation in Russia. Sales outperformed volume due to favorable pricing, primarily in laundry and paper products, and favorable exchange effects in Western Europe. The region's net earnings declined two percent due to the impact of the economic crisis in Russia. Excluding Russia, earnings in the region increased by double digits. The decline in unit volume caused by the economic crisis in Russia was partially offset by the launch of initiatives in the region. The beverage business showed significant improvement behind the continued success of the Sunny Delight launch in the United Kingdom, where results are nearly double our initial objectives. The region also benefited from the expansion of Pringles into multiple countries and the continued tissue/towel regional expansion. For the nine months ended March 31, 1999, sales increased two percent on a three percent decline in unit volume. Net earnings increased six percent. Net sales in Asia for the three months ended March 31, 1999 increased eight percent versus the same quarter of the prior year, on a six percent decline in unit volume. The increase in sales was driven by improved pricing throughout the region and strengthening exchange rates in Japan and Korea. Net earnings for the quarter increased 117 percent versus a weak year ago base period, as improved pricing more than offset increased investment on new brand initiatives. The region's volumes continue to be impacted by recession and market contraction in several of the developing markets. However, Japan continues to grow unit volume and market share in its base businesses behind the successful launch of several initiatives in paper, laundry and cleaning and beauty care. For the nine months ended March 31, 1999, sales increased two percent on flat unit volume. Net earnings increased 21 percent. Net sales in Latin America for the three months ended March 31, 1999 were flat versus the same quarter of the prior year, on six percent decline in unit volume. Improved pricing across the region offset unfavorable exchange rates. Volume was negatively impacted by continued competitive pressures in laundry & cleaning, primarily in the Southern Cone, and a reduction in trade inventory levels in Mexico. Earnings for the region were down 16 percent, as the improved pricing was more than offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased investment in initiatives, particularly the expansion of Ariel into the Southern For the nine months ended March 31, 1999, sales increased seven percent on a four percent increase in unit volume. Net earnings increased four percent. Total debt increased $1.4 billion since June 30, 1998. The incremental debt was used primarily to finance the previously announced share repurchase program.

As previously announced, the Company is currently designing Organization 2005, a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture to accelerate growth. We anticipate there will be significant costs associated with this reorganization that are beyond our current ongoing program of simplification and standardization. These costs, which will commence in the final quarter of the current fiscal year, involve the costs to transition from a geographic basis of management to product-based Global Business Units, standardize and streamline our selling, administrative, and product supply organizations and transition to our Global Business Services organization. We are still completing the design work which will enable us to determine the specific nature, amount and timing of these costs, and we'll provide more information late this fiscal year.

1999-11-05,10-Q,0000080424-99-000033,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.15 billion or $0.80 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 1999. These results include charges related to the Company's Organization 2005 program, which was announced last June. This multi-year program is associated with the Company's reorganization to product-based Global Business Units, as described more fully below. Core net earnings per diluted share, which exclude the Organization 2005 costs, were $0.88, a ten percent increase over the first quarter of last year. Core net earnings were $1.27 billion, excluding $120 million after tax in charges related to Organization 2005. This solid progress reflects a continued cost-containment focus in the face of significant initiative investments that yielded initial results in the first quarter and laid the foundation for future growth. Reported net sales for the first quarter were a record $9.92 billion, up four percent. Net sales grew five percent, excluding a one percent impact of negative exchange rates, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Unit volume grew two percent. New premium-priced initiatives and product upgrades boosted sales ahead Gross margin was 47.5 percent for the current quarter compared to 45.9 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 44.8 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. Included in Cost of Product Sold is $105 million before tax related to Organization 2005. Gross margin was positively impacted this quarter by improved pricing, product mix, and lower manufacturing expenses. Operating margin was 18.6 percent for the quarter compared to 19.7 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.4 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $160 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 20.2 percent, primarily due to gross margin improvement. Following are highlights by business segment: As the Company's biggest and fastest-growing business unit, Fabric and Home Care set the pace for the Company's results. Net sales grew eight percent to $3.16 billion on four percent unit volume growth supplemented by the launch of higher-margin initiatives and product upgrades. Currency impacts depressed sales by one percent. The recent launches of Swiffer and Dryel in North America and strong base business results drove volume gains. Share-building initiative activity in Northeast Asia spurred double-digit volume growth in the geography. Ariel tablets performed well after their spring launch in the United Kingdom and are currently being expanded in Western Europe. Net earnings grew ten percent to $484 million, reflecting volume growth and improved pricing, despite continued initiative investment and the impact of unfavorable currency movements, The Paper business demonstrated strong volume gains on certain key brands, behind an upgrade on Charmin and increased capacity on Bounty and Charmin. These results were mitigated by significant competitive activity, particularly in diapers and feminine care products. Excluding a two percent impact from the Attends divestiture, volume and net sales were stable for the quarter, with net sales at $3.01 billion. On the base business, successful pricing measures on certain brands and markets were offset by negative currency impacts. Despite the improved pricing, chiefly behind product upgrades in diapers, increased spending in a difficult competitive environment resulted in net earnings of $343 million, Food and Beverage posted a strong first quarter. Geographical expansion in both snacks and juice helped push sales up five percent to $1.21 billion, on comparable unit volume growth. A slate of new initiatives in North America, including Folgers Whole Bean, Pringles Twin Pack, Sunny Delight Eclipse, and Jif Smooth Sensations, along with the expansion of Pringles and Sunny Delight across Western Europe, drove the volume growth. Earnings grew 35 percent to $106 million, behind the volume gains on the base business, higher-margin initiatives, and improved gross margin. During the first quarter, Beauty Care continued to see benefits from the launch of Oil of Olay Cosmetics, as well as a number of other premium initiatives. Premium initiatives, as well as favorable currency impacts in Northeast Asia, helped offset a three percent unit volume decline to maintain sales in line with year-ago levels at $1.82 billion. Currency effects contributed one percent to the sales increase. Volume comparisons reflect strong year-ago results and the current competitive environment, primarily for hair care in key European markets. Western Europe results were negatively impacted by the recent introduction of new trade terms in France and the prior year divestiture of certain minor brands. Volume also was impacted by economic sluggishness in China that dampened consumption and certain trade inventory adjustments in advance of current quarter pricing actions. Net earnings were $225 million, down four percent as volume declines and initiative spending offset pricing improvements. Health Care segment results included the integration of the newly acquired pet health and nutrition business, The Iams Company, in September, 1999. Net sales increased 16 percent to $799 million on seven percent unit volume growth, primarily reflecting the Iams acquisition. Negative exchange impacts reduced sales by one percent for the quarter. Net earnings were $91 million, a 29 percent increase over the prior year. The overall segment earnings reflect the benefits of favorable pricing and increased licensing and divestiture activity, which more than offset continued investment behind future initiatives and The Corporate segment includes certain financing and investing activities, other general corporate income and expense items, segment eliminations, and Organization 2005 costs which amounted to $120 million after tax for the July-September, 1999 quarter. Total debt increased $2.7 billion since June 30, 1999. The incremental debt was used primarily to fund the previously announced share repurchase program and the acquisition of The Iams Company, which was completed August 31, 1999. As outlined in the 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company has substantially completed its program to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the Year 2000. These plans have not changed materially in terms of scope or estimated costs to complete, and have progressed according to previously identified time schedules. Implementation of required changes to critical systems is complete. Testing and certification of critical systems, which includes review of documented remediation work and test results by technical experts, key users, and a central project team, was successfully completed by September 30, 1999. The focus in this area is now on maintaining Year 2000 readiness. The Company's risk management program, which was expanded to include the Year 2000 Business Continuity Plan (BCP), was completed by October 31, 1999, consistent with previously identified time schedules. The objectives of the BCP are twofold: 1) to ensure business-critical processes are protected from disruption and will continue to function during and after the year 2000; and, 2) to ensure the Company's ability to produce an acceptable level of products and services is safeguarded in the event of failures of external systems and services. The BCP includes, for example, identification of alternative suppliers or customers, possible increases in safety inventory levels and other backup procedures. Businesses and assets acquired by the Company after June 30, 1999 but prior to the end of 1999 are subjected by the Company to a Year 2000 assessment process and, where feasible, representations as to Year 2000 readiness are obtained from the seller. Post-closing, the Company will take such actions as it considers necessary regarding Year 2000 readiness, including modification or remediation Incremental costs related to Year 2000 efforts, which include contractor costs to modify existing systems and costs of internal resources dedicated to achieving and maintaining Year 2000 compliance, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs are expected to total approximately $90 million, of which over 90% has been spent through September 30, 1999. The Company is taking all reasonable steps to prevent major interruptions in the business due to Year 2000 issues. The effect, if any, on the Company's financial statements if the Company, its customers, its suppliers, or the public sector are not fully Year 2000 compliant is not reasonably estimable. The Company believes, however, that the successful completion of its Year 2000 project will significantly reduce the risk of a major business interruption due to Year 2000 failures. Additionally, the Company's broad base of customers and suppliers and the worldwide nature of its operations is expected to mitigate any Year 2000 On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company needs to make a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations. Charges related to Organization 2005 consist primarily of costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities (including accelerated depreciation, asset writedowns and contract termination costs) and employee separation costs. During the quarter ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded expenses totaling $160 million before tax related to Organization 2005, as detailed in ORGANIZATION 2005 JULY-SEPTEMBER, 1999 CHARGES (BEFORE TAX) Total Spent Charged Beginning New During Against Ending Reserves Charges Period Assets Reserves Organization 2005 charges are included in the Company's cost of products sold ($105 million) and in marketing, research and administrative expenses ($55 million), and are included in Corporate & Other in the Company's segment reporting disclosure. The underlying plant closures and consolidations will impact all regions and product segments. The planned plant closures and consolidations will not all be executed immediately due to either capacity or Employee separation charges in July-September, 1999 relate to severance packages for approximately 700 people, representing primarily administrative employees in North America, Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa. The predominantly voluntary packages are formula-driven, based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer in accordance with P&G policy for such programs. On average, net enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 75% of total separations, as some terminations will be partially offset through increased enrollment at remaining sites. Of total separations expected through fiscal 2001, approximately half will take place in manufacturing with the balance in administrative functions. Separation costs related to manufacturing employees are included in cost of products sold, while those for administrative employees are reported in marketing, research and administrative expenses. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization and closures that will occur primarily over the next three years as a result of the Organization 2005 program. The Company has changed the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in an acceleration of depreciation. The majority of accelerated depreciation recorded in the July-September, 1999 quarter is concentrated in the Paper segment and reflects the standardization of manufacturing and other work processes being undertaken in that segment. Other costs include primarily relocation and training costs, as well as other Organization 2005-related expenses. Such costs are expensed as incurred. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",1855
2000-01-27,10-Q,0000080424-00-000003,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.1 billion or $0.78 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 1999, including charges of $137 million related to its Organization 2005 program. Organization 2005 is the Company's multi-year initiative designed to accelerate growth by increasing innovation and speed to market. The objective of the program is to increase long-term sales growth to six-to-eight percent annually and increase growth in core net earnings per share to 13 to 15 percent over a five year period. Core net earnings per diluted share, which exclude Organization 2005 costs, were $0.88, a 13 percent increase over the second quarter of last year. Net sales increased seven percent to a record $10.6 billion. Sales growth, resulting from faster speed to market with initiatives and a greater strategic focus from the Organization 2005 program, represented the largest quarterly increase since 1997. Exchange rates, primarily Western Europe and Brazil partially offset by Japan, negatively impacted sales by two percentage points. Unit volume grew six percent, reflecting continued initiative activity around the world, base business growth and acquisitions. For the first six months, reported net earnings were $2.3 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share. Worldwide sales grew five percent to $20.5 billion, including a two percent impact from unfavorable exchange rates on four percent unit volume growth. Core net earnings were $2.5 billion, while core diluted net earnings per share grew 11 percent to $1.76. Gross margin was 47.5 percent for the current quarter compared to 46.3 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 44.8 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. Included in Cost of Products Sold is $110 million before tax related to Organization 2005. Excluding Organization 2005 costs, core gross margin reached 48.5 percent. Gross margin improvement this quarter reflected continued focus on cost control, improved pricing and shifts towards premium Operating margin was 17.4 percent for the quarter compared to 18.5 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.4 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $183 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 19.1 percent, primarily driven by gross margin improvement. For the six-month period, gross margin was 47.5 percent, versus 46.1 percent in the same period a year ago. Excluding $215 million in costs related to Organization 2005, gross margin was 48.5 percent. For the current six-month period, operating margin fell to 18 percent versus 19.1 percent in the July-December, 1998 period. Excluding $343 million before tax in Organization 2005 costs, operating margin increased to 19.7 percent. Following are highlights by business segment: Fabric and home care continued to deliver strong results. Sales increased 10 percent to $3.17 billion, or 12 percent excluding unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from euro-denominated countries and Brazil. Base business strength and initiatives combined to ignite top-line growth. Febreze, Swiffer and Dryel sales continued to grow strongly from global expansion and the introduction of new line extensions. Unit volume grew eight percent, double the growth rate posted in the September quarter this year. Volume gains were broad-based across major markets in North America and Western Europe. Both volume and share growth were particularly strong in Northeast Asia and the Southern Cone (Brazil, Argentina, Chile). Net earnings grew seven percent to $405 million, on improved gross margin, partially offset by increased costs related to initiatives and negative exchange rate impacts. The Company also announced plans to introduce Ariel liquid in Japan and to launch another innovative new product, Fit Fruit and Vegetable Wash, in the United States this For the first six months of the fiscal year, a six percent unit volume increase and higher-value initiatives drove sales up nine percent. Net earnings increased Paper results improved during the second quarter, with net sales up one percent to $3.18 billion. Excluding negative exchange rate impacts, largely due to the euro, net sales grew three percent. Unit volume grew three percent behind strong increases on Charmin and Bounty and improved performance in diapers, despite continuing competitive issues in feminine care. The divestiture of the Attends adult incontinence business weakened comparisons, negatively impacting volume and sales by two percent versus the same quarter last year. Earnings declined 15 percent to $293 million, behind continued investment in new initiatives, geographic expansion and rising pulp prices. The effect of prior pricing actions, primarily in baby care, were offset by price reductions in earlier quarters taken on tissue/towel in reaction to competitive activities and negative mix effects in diapers. An upgraded Tampax product based on closed-end satin technology was introduced in Ireland and Switzerland, as part of the Company's focus to build the business through product innovation. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down one percent on flat unit volume. Net earnings fell eight percent. Beauty care was impacted by a difficult competitive environment, especially in Greater China and Western Europe, and the double impact of declining consumption and price deflation in China, where the hair care market has been especially hard hit by the weakened economy. Sales fell three percent to $1.90 billion on a five percent volume decline. Net earnings were equal to year ago at $273 million, as pricing programs and progress on cost control offset incremental spending and costs related to initiatives. The Company's response to the situation in China, which is focused on stimulating consumption through price reductions on specific hair care brands and complemented by a strong sachet drive, is beginning to rebuild the business in that country. The Company also continues to emphasize long-term value creation through investment in premium initiatives, such as Secret Platinum and Oil of Olay Cosmetics. Several new product upgrades and launches, including the U.S. launch of the Physique styling-led hair care brand, are planned for the back half of the year. For the first six months of the year, unit volume fell four percent. Sales and net earnings fell two percent. The health care segment, which includes new venture activities, delivered strong results this quarter behind the acquisitions of Iams and Recovery Engineering, with its water filtration brand, PuR. Net sales increased 35 percent to $1.07 billion on 33 percent unit volume growth. Net earnings were up 57 percent to $125 million, driven by outstanding progress by Iams that supplemented solid base business earnings. The Company recently announced that Iams pet food products will be expanded to new retail channels in the coming quarter, only a few months after the integration of the acquisition. Health care also introduced ThermaCare portable heat wraps, which are intended to change the way consumers think about pain relief, and announced further progress with Actonel, the Company's new osteoporosis drug. The Swedish government approved Actonel for use with Corticosteroid-Induced Osteoporosis and Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis in October, 1999, while FDA approval is expected in the near future. On a year-to-date basis, net sales increased 26 percent with unit volume up 21 percent. Net earnings increased 44 percent. Improvements were driven by the newly acquired businesses, as well as strong growth in leading respiratory Continued expansion of snacks across geographies, mainly in Western Europe, drove strong quarterly results, with sales increasing four percent to $1.32 billion on comparable unit volume growth. Recent launches of Pringles in Spain and Italy and the introduction of the Pringles Pizzalicious flavor in Japan are yielding great results. Excluding the effects of the Hawaiian Punch divestiture, volume grew nine percent, boosted by recent initiative launches of Folgers Whole Bean, Pringles Twin Pack, Sunny Delight Eclipse, and Jif Smooth Sensations. Significant improvements in gross margin, behind a sharpened focus on cost control, boosted earnings 23 percent to $137 million, despite investments in new For the first half of the year, sales increased five percent on four percent unit volume growth. Net earnings climbed 28 percent, reflecting cost The Company confirmed that it was comfortable with the current range of analyst estimates for fiscal year earnings. However, earnings growth may be more concentrated in the April-June quarter, given heavy initiative spending planned for the January-March quarter. Volume and sales increases through the remainder of the year are expected to be above the growth achieved in the July-December period. For fiscal year 2001 and beyond, the Company has raised its internal expectations and is targeting for earnings growth near the top of its 13 to 15 percent target range, as it continues to see increased financial benefits flowing from Organization 2005. Total debt increased $4.1 billion since June 30, 1999. The incremental debt was used primarily to fund the previously announced share repurchase program and the acquisitions of the Iams Company and Recovery Engineering. For the six-month period ended December 31, 1999, cash generated from operating activities totaled $1.5 billion, down from $2.0 billion in the same prior year period. Most of the decrease resulted from increased investment in working capital, driven by lower accrual balances and inventory accumulation in advance Capital spending increased $322 million versus the year ago period, including Organization 2005-driven spending. Investment in acquisitions totaled $3.1 billion, compared to $0.1 billion in the prior period. As described in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company had developed plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the Year 2000. Since entering the year 2000, the Company has not experienced any major disruptions to its business nor is it aware of any significant Year 2000-related disruptions impacting its customers and suppliers. Furthermore, the Company did not experience any material impact on inventories at calendar year end. The Company will continue to monitor its critical systems over the next several months but does not anticipate any significant impacts due to Year 2000 exposures from its internal systems as well as from the activities of its suppliers and customers. Costs incurred to achieve Year 2000 readiness, which include contractor costs to modify existing systems and costs of internal resources dedicated to achieving Year 2000 compliance, were charged to expense as incurred. Such costs totaled approximately $90 million and were largely incurred prior to the current fiscal On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company needs to make a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations. Charges related to Organization 2005 consist primarily of costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities (including accelerated depreciation, asset writedowns and contract termination costs) and employee separation costs. During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded expenses totaling $183 million before tax related to Organization 2005, as detailed in Organization 2005 July-December, 1999 Charges (before tax) For the July-December Period Beginning Quarter Quarter Total Charged Ending Reserves Charges New Charges Cash Against Reserve at 6/30/99 Jul-Sep 99 Charges Jul-Dec Spent Assets 12/31/99 During October-December, 1999, Organization 2005 costs charged against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $110 million, while charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses amounted to $73 million. Charges related to Organization 2005 are included in Corporate & Other in the Company's segment reporting disclosure. The underlying plant closures and consolidations will impact all regions and product segments. Planned plant closures and consolidations will not all be executed immediately due to either capacity or logistics constraints. For the July-December, 1999 period, total charges related to Organization 2005 amounted to $343 million before tax. Employee separation charges in October-December, 1999 are associated with severance packages for approximately 310 people, representing primarily administrative employees in North America, Asia, and Europe. For the fiscal year-to-date period, separation charges related to Organization 2005 totaled $72 million, and relate to approximately 1,010 terminations. The predominantly voluntary packages are formula-driven, based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer in accordance with P&G policy for such programs. On average, net enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 75% of total separations, as some terminations will be partially offset through increased enrollment at remaining sites. Of total separations expected through fiscal 2001, approximately half will take place in manufacturing with the balance in administrative functions. Separation costs related to manufacturing employees are included in cost of products sold, while those for administrative employees are reported in marketing, research and administrative expenses. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization and closures that will occur primarily over the next three years as a result of the Organization 2005 program. The Company has changed the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in an acceleration of depreciation. Approximately 60% of the $99 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in the October-December, 1999 quarter is concentrated in the paper segment and reflects the standardization of manufacturing and other work processes being undertaken in that segment. Most of the balance is concentrated in the beauty care and fabric and home care segments. For the six month period ended December, 1999, total charges related to accelerated depreciation amounted to $199 million before tax. Charges for other costs related to Organization 2005 amounted to $52 million during the October-December, 1999 quarter, and consisted primarily of costs associated with the restructuring of certain beauty care categories, as well as relocation, training costs and other Organization 2005-related expenses. For the fiscal year-to-date period, other costs totaled $63 million. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",2299

2000-04-28,10-Q,0000080424-00-000009,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $753 million or $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2000, including charges of $170 million related to its Organization 2005 program. Core net earnings per diluted share, which exclude the Organization 2005 costs, were $0.64. This 11 percent decline over the third quarter of last year is primarily due to higher costs, including increased investments behind consumer and customer initiatives and a slight Net sales grew six percent to $9.78 billion. Exchange rates, primarily the euro, depressed sales by about two percent. A strong Japanese yen and Mexican peso partially offset the weaker currencies in Western Europe. Unit volume grew seven percent, reflecting stepped-up initiative activity across geographies, base business strength, and acquisition effects, primarily Iams. For the first nine months, reported net earnings were $3.03 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share. Worldwide net sales grew six percent to $30.29 billion on five percent unit volume growth, despite a one percent impact of unfavorable exchange rates. Core net earnings were $3.45 billion, generating core diluted net earnings per share of $2.40, a four percent increase. Gross margin was 45.5 percent for the current quarter compared to 46.9 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 44.8 percent for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. Impacting gross margin is a before-tax charge of $107 million related to the Organization 2005 restructuring project. Excluding this charge, core gross margin was 46.6 percent, down from the prior year behind commodity-related cost increases and exchange impacts. Operating margin was 13.5 percent for the January-March quarter versus 18.0 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 16.4 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $184 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 15.4 percent. The decline in operating margin was driven by the gross margin decrease, as well as heavy initiative investments. The initiative investments most negatively affected marketing, research, and administrative expenses, which increased considerably versus the same quarter in the prior For the nine-month period, gross margin was 46.9 percent, an increase versus 46.4 percent reported in the same period a year ago. Excluding Organization 2005 charges of $322 million before tax, gross margin was 47.9 percent. Operating margin on a year-to-date basis was 16.5 percent compared to 18.7 percent for the same period last year. Without Organization 2005 charges of $527 million before tax, operating margin was 18.3 percent. Fabric and home care continued to deliver strong top-line results, with unit volume growth of eight percent behind global initiative activity and solid base business performance in North America. Sales increased seven percent, to $2.94 billion, including a two percent negative currency impact. Importantly, overall global market share grew, with Latin America delivering substantial share progress and top-line growth in the face of heavy competitive activity. Net earnings were $283 million, a decline of 26 percent. These results reflect the significant investments behind new initiatives including Mr. Clean Wipes and Fit Fruit and Vegetable Wash, the expansion of Dryel, Swiffer, and Mr. Proper Wipes, innovative customer marketing programs and increases in petroleum-related costs. Western European earnings were significantly impacted by initiative investment and response to heavy competitive activity. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, higher value initiatives drove sales up eight percent and unit volume up seven percent. Net earnings decreased Paper continues to face significant challenges including unfavorable cost trends and a difficult competitive environment. Volume was up one percent on the quarter, as solid volume progress in the tissue and towel business offset weakness in diapers and the prior year divestiture of Attends in feminine care products. Sales of $2.93 billion were down three percent, driven by a three percent negative currency impact. Rising pulp prices, capacity expansion and initiative investments depressed earnings, bringing them down 27 percent to $218 million. Charmin and Bounty posted solid gains behind product upgrades and geographical expansion. The segment announced pricing plans to counter rising commodity-related raw material increases, effective for the April-June quarter. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down one percent on flat unit volume. Net earnings fell 14 percent. Beauty care posted solid growth in the January-March quarter, reflecting an improving business trend. Sales grew well ahead of volume, and the business generated earnings growth despite heavy initiative investments. Sales grew seven percent to $1.90 billion on a four percent unit volume increase fueled by premium initiatives in hair care, including the Physique styling-led hair care line. Earnings increased 13 percent to $231 million, bolstered by premium-priced For the first nine months of the fiscal year, sales grew one percent, despite a two percent unit volume decline. Net earnings were up two percent. Health care results highlight the benefits of acquisitions, as Iams drove volume and sales growth. Sales were up 52 percent to $1.08 billion, on 59 percent volume growth. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, volume was down one percent, as a slower cold and flu season offset strong gains in oral care. Earnings were up 74 percent to $101 million. Earnings excluding Iams were down, as the business continued to invest in its portfolio of new products. As expected, the regulatory approval of Actonel for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis was recently obtained, with marketing efforts and shipments to Year-to-date, volume increased 33 percent with net sales up 34 percent. Net earnings increased 52 percent. Results in food and beverage were negatively impacted by a divestiture in the prior year and commodity-related pricing actions. Sales declined 11 percent to $976 million on an eight percent unit volume decline. Excluding the divestiture impacts, unit volume was down three percent. Pricing actions affected both market size and timing of shipments in the segment, primarily in coffee. Volume was also negatively impacted by softness in Sunny Delight in Western Europe and snacks in the United States. Earnings were down 32 percent to $50 million, reflecting the Hawaiian Punch divestiture last year and initiative-related cost increases, particularly in Western Europe, where we are launching Sunny Delight For the first nine months of the fiscal year, unit volume was up one percent on flat net sales. Net earnings increased 11 percent. The corporate segment includes certain financing and employee benefit costs, goodwill amortization, other general corporate income and expense items, segment eliminations and Organization 2005 charges. Due to the nature of its components, results can vary significantly by quarter and year. In the January-March quarter, earnings declined sharply due to the Organization 2005 charges. Excluding Organization 2005, gains on the settlement of a patent dispute with Paragon Trade Brands and the divestiture of the Chloraseptic brand were offset by higher costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, higher interest expense, goodwill amortization and corporate innovation investments. Total debt increased $4.1 billion since June 30, 1999. The incremental debt was used primarily to fund the previously announced share repurchase program and the acquisitions of the Iams Company and Recovery Engineering. During its March, 2000 meeting, the Board of Directors approved increasing the Company's authorization to repurchase its shares to 56 million, up from 40 million. For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2000, cash generated from operating activities totaled $2.9 billion, down from $3.6 billion in the same period in the prior year. The decrease resulted primarily from incremental investments in working capital and lower earnings versus a year ago. Acquisitions were up $2.8 billion versus the year ago period. Capital spending grew $152 million, versus the year ago period, including capital projects related to Organization 2005. The Company confirmed that it is comfortable with the current range of analysts' earnings estimates. April-June volume growth currently is estimated at five to seven percent. The Company also noted that the increase in net income for the April-June quarter will result from an increase in income from the corporate segment. Business units will be negatively impacted by continued investment in new initiatives, and they will likely report profit results which are flat or down versus fourth quarter a year ago. On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company will make a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations.

For the July-March, 2000 period, total charges related to Organization 2005 amounted to $527 million before tax. Employee separation charges in January-March, 2000 are associated with severance packages for approximately 300 people, representing primarily administrative employees in North America, Asia, and Europe, along with production employees in Latin America. For the fiscal year-to-date period, separation charges related to Organization 2005 totaled $110 million, and relate to approximately 1,310 terminations. The predominantly voluntary packages are formula-driven, based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer in accordance with P&G policy for such programs. On average, net enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 75% of total separations, as some terminations will be partially offset through increased enrollment at remaining sites.

Most of the remaining balance is concentrated in the beauty care and fabric and home care segments. For the nine month period ended March 31, 2000, total charges related to accelerated depreciation amounted to $299 million before tax. Charges for other costs related to Organization 2005 amounted to $42 million during the January-March, 2000 quarter, and consisted primarily of costs associated with the restructuring of certain beauty care categories, as well as relocation, training costs and other Organization 2005-related expenses.

2000-11-02,10-Q,0000080424-00-000053,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.16 billion or $0.82 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. Results include an $85 million after-tax charge related to the Organization 2005 restructuring program. Core net earnings, which exclude the Organization 2005 charges, were $1.24 billion for the quarter. Core net earnings per share were equal to the prior year at $0.88. Earnings results were influenced by significant commodity-related cost increases and negative exchange impacts, which more than offset the benefits of pricing and a focus on growth of premium-priced products. Net sales grew one percent, consistent with unit volume, reaching $9.97 billion. Gains from improved pricing and higher volume were partially offset by the negative impact of exchange rates. Excluding currency effects, primarily from the euro, sales grew four percent. Gross margin was 46.8 percent for the current quarter compared to 47.5 percent in the same quarter of the prior year and 46.1 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. Included in cost of products sold is a before-tax charge of $63 million related to Organization 2005. Excluding Organization 2005 costs, core gross margin reached 47.4 percent, down from the prior year as improved pricing and premium products were more than offset by commodity-cost increases. Operating margin was 17.8 percent for the quarter compared to 18.6 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 14.9 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $105 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 18.9 percent. Operating margin declined primarily due to the gross margin Unit volume was flat, as gains in North America laundry ahead of the price increase were offset by softness in Western Europe. Net sales declined three percent to $3.08 billion, primarily reflecting a three percent unfavorable foreign exchange impact, driven by Western European currencies. Net earnings were $498 million, up three percent. Earnings progress was due to lower costs in developing markets, minor brand divestitures and lower taxes. Comparisons were impacted by strong results in the prior year, when significant initiative activity, including sell-in of Swiffer and Dryel, fueled eight percent sales and 10 percent earnings growth. The business continued to invest in new initiatives in the current quarter, with recent launches of Downy Wrinkle Releaser and Tide Tablets in North America. Unit volume was up one percent behind improved performance in diapers, notably in Latin America, and growth in Western Europe and China. Net sales also increased one percent to $3.04 billion, as pricing mitigated a four percent unfavorable exchange impact. Volume and sales growth reflected the successful introductions of new products in baby care and feminine care. Net earnings declined four percent to $329 million as progress in marketing, research and administrative spending was offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Significant commodity-related cost increases were countered by pricing actions, primarily in tissues/towel and feminine care. Unit volume was flat versus year ago as strong growth in hair care was offset by significant competitive activity in personal cleansing and deodorants in North America and by Western Europe business softness. Net sales grew two percent to $1.87 billion, including a three percent unfavorable exchange impact. Sales were ahead of volume due to pricing and the continued focus on high-performance, premium-priced initiatives. Net earnings were $267 million, a 19 percent increase, reflecting the benefit of improved pricing, lower taxes and comparison to a weak year ago base period. Double-digit volume and sales growth in health care was led by continued outstanding progress on Iams pet health and nutrition business which was acquired in September 1999. Unit volume climbed 34 percent versus the prior year and sales grew 24 percent to $990 million, including a two percent negative impact from weaker currencies. Net earnings were $81 million, an 11 percent decline, as growth from acquisitions was outweighed by last year's high level of licensing and divestiture activity. Base business net earnings grew by double-digits, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and licensing Unit volume and sales declined 11 percent and 13 percent respectively, reflecting softness in both the snacks and beverage businesses. Pringles volume was down in part due to trade inventory builds in advance of an announced June price increase. The beverage business declined as a result of a heavy competitive climate in juice. Net sales were $1.05 billion, including a two percent negative impact from currency rate changes. Net earnings decreased 29 percent to $75 million, due to lower volume and the associated cost impact. Total debt increased $535 million since June 30, 2000. The incremental debt was used primarily to fund the Company's ongoing share repurchase program. The Company confirmed its prior guidance of core earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digits, or a range of $0.91 to $0.93 per share. October-December sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to be up slightly with volume down in the low-single-digits. The second quarter results will benefit from the Company's ongoing minor brand divestiture program, including the divestiture of Clearasil. These results are against a particularly strong year ago base period, where volume increased six percent and core earnings grew 11 percent, driven by a strong new brand launch program. On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 restructuring program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company will make a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations. Charges related to Organization 2005 consist primarily of costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities (including accelerated depreciation, asset writedowns and contract termination costs) and employee separation costs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded expenses totaling $107 million before tax related to Organization 2005, as detailed in Organization 2005 July-September, 2000 Charges (before tax) Beginning Charged Ending Reserves Total Cash Against Reserves at 6/30/00 Charges Spent Assets 9/30/00 During July-September, 2000, Organization 2005 costs charged against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $63 million, while charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses and other expenses amounted to $44 million. Charges related to Organization 2005 are included in Corporate in the Company's segment disclosures. The underlying plant closures and consolidations will impact all regions and product segments. Planned plant closures and consolidations will not all be executed immediately due to either capacity or logistics constraints. Employee separation charges in July-September, 2000 are associated with severance packages for approximately 430 people, representing primarily administrative employees in North America, Asia, and Europe, along with production employees in Asia. The predominantly voluntary packages are formula-driven, based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer in accordance with P&G policy for such programs. On average, net enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 85% of total separations, as some terminations will be partially offset through increased enrollment at remaining sites. Of total separations expected through fiscal 2001, approximately half will take place in manufacturing with the balance in administrative functions. Separation costs related to manufacturing employees are included in cost of products sold, while those for administrative employees are reported in marketing, research and administrative expenses. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization and closures that will occur primarily over the next two years as a result of the Organization 2005 program. The Company has changed the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in an acceleration of depreciation. Approximately 60% of the $52 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in the July-September, 2000 quarter is concentrated in the paper segment and reflects the standardization of manufacturing and other work processes being undertaken in that segment. Most of the remaining balance is concentrated in the beauty care and fabric and home Charges for other costs related to Organization 2005 amounted to $22 million during the July-September, 2000 quarter, and consisted primarily of costs associated with relocation, training and other Organization 2005-related expenses. These costs are expensed as incurred. In December, 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."" The effective date has been deferred pending additional interpretive guidance. Based on current interpretations, no material impact on the Company's financial statements is anticipated. PART II.

2001-02-01,10-Q,0000080424-01-000004,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.19 billion or $0.84 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2000. Results included a $120 million after-tax charge related to the Organization 2005 restructuring program. Core net earnings, which exclude the Organization 2005 charges, were $1.31 billion for the quarter. Core net earnings per share were $0.93, a six percent increase Net sales were $10.18 billion for the quarter. This is equal to year ago record levels, after adjusting for a four percent unfavorable currency impact, primarily the euro. Unit volume was down two percent against an all-time record quarter last year, when new brand introductions, strong initiative activity and marketing support, and geographic expansions of established brands fueled Business segment after-tax earnings were up two percent as pricing and tax savings offset the impact of foreign exchange and increased product costs, driven by higher commodity-based prices. The sale of Clearasil added approximately $146 million after tax to the corporate segment, and was an important factor in delivering the six percent core net earnings per share For the first six months, reported net earnings were $2.35 billion, or $1.66 per share. Results included a charge of $205 million after-tax related to the Organization 2005 program. Excluding Organization 2005 charges, core net earnings were $2.55 billion, while core net earnings per share grew three percent to $1.81. Worldwide sales were down two percent to $20.15 billion, including a four percent effect due to unfavorable exchange rates, on flat unit Gross margin was 46.8 percent for the current quarter compared to 47.5 percent in the same quarter of the prior year, and 46.1 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. Included in cost of products sold is a before-tax charge of $81 million related to Organization 2005. Excluding Organization 2005 costs, gross margin was 47.6 percent, down from the year ago quarter as commodity-related cost increases and unfavorable exchange impacts were not fully offset by pricing actions. Operating margin was 16.8 percent for the quarter compared to 17.4 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 14.9 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $154 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 18.3 percent. The decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the For the six-month period, gross margin was 46.8 percent, comparable to the quarter results, and below the 47.5 percent reported in the same period a year The following provides additional perspective on the Company's results by The Company's largest segment, fabric and home care, began to show signs of share improvement, despite a continued difficult competitive environment. Net earnings were $390 million, down four percent against particularly strong growth in the prior year. Net sales were $2.93 billion, with a four percent volume decline exacerbated by a five percent unfavorable exchange impact. The unit volume trend reflects the strength of the year-ago base period, which included the initial shipments of Swiffer, Febreze and Dryel, as well as the impact of inventory builds in advance of last quarter's North America laundry price increase. Recent pricing actions in Western Europe and laundry product improvements in North America are designed to improve the value equation with consumers to support achievement of our future growth objectives. For the first six months of the fiscal year, unit volume was down two percent. Sales fell five percent while earnings were equal to year-ago levels. The paper segment posted a one percent growth in net earnings as pricing and a disciplined focus on controllable costs countered exchange impacts and higher raw material prices. Net earnings for the quarter were $295 million. Excluding a five percent unfavorable exchange impact, net sales grew one percent to $3.05 billion. Pricing benefits, primarily in North America tissues and towel and baby care, mitigated a slight decrease in unit volume. Growth in Latin America volume, primarily in baby care, was offset by a decline in North America, following particularly strong results in the prior year. This segment continues to face competitive challenges and is focused on the best approaches to deliver a winning consumer value equation in the future. For the first half of the year, unit volume was flat while net sales and net earnings were down two percent. Beauty care also delivered net earnings growth, as the segment continues to focus on premium products. Net earnings grew five percent to $286 million. The business supported continued investment in business-building initiatives by managing costs, primarily lower taxes. Share progress on key brands was not directly reflected in top-line results due to trade inventory adjustments, primarily related to the Pantene relaunch. Net sales were $1.86 billion, down two percent driven entirely by a five percent negative impact of currency. Excluding exchange, the net sales growth in the face of a two percent decline in unit volume reflects the benefit of pricing as the business extends its hair and skin care product lines. Notable progress was achieved in the hair care business in Latin America, and earnings progress in China following challenges in the On a year-to-date basis, unit volume was down one percent while sales were flat. Net earnings grew 11 percent driven by higher value initiatives. On top of record results in the year ago quarter, the health care segment again delivered excellent growth, reflecting strong execution of initiative plans. Net earnings grew 31 percent to $164 million. Disciplined focus on costs complemented top-line growth, particularly in Iams, North America pharmaceuticals, and oral care. Net sales were up seven percent to $1.15 billion, including a three percent negative impact from weaker currencies. Excluding this effect, the double-digit sales growth was driven by an 11 percent increase in unit volume. Iams continues to exceed expectations, as the expansion into new retail channels has delivered substantial growth, while it continues to be number one in pet specialty outlets. For the first six months of the year, unit volume increased 21 percent with net sales and net earnings up 14 percent. The food and beverage segment remained below the record level of a year ago, reflecting the continued impacts of the competitive environment and transition impacts of a re-sizing initiative on Pringles. Net earnings were $124 million, down nine percent, due to lower volume versus record shipments in the year ago quarter. Net sales were $1.18 billion, down 11 percent due to a seven percent decline in unit volume and a three percent impact of unfavorable exchange rates. Year-to-date, unit volume reflected a nine percent decline while net sales declined 12 percent. Net earnings were 18 percent below a year ago. Total debt increased $2.1 billion since June 30, 2000, as the Company increased its foreign currency debt exposure to obtain favorable interest rates and to fund the Company's ongoing share repurchase program. For the six-month period ended December 31, 2000, cash generated from operating activities totaled $2.3 billion, up from $1.5 billion in the same period in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from improvements in working Acquisitions were down $3.1 billion versus the year ago period, which included the Iams Company and Recovery Engineering. Capital spending declined $201 million versus the year ago period, reflecting slowing spending patterns while continuing Organization 2005-related capital projects. FISCAL YEAR AND THIRD QUARTER ESTIMATES The Company confirmed that it is comfortable with the high end of the current range of analysts' estimates for core net earnings per share growth for the year. Based on current trends and expectations, the Company now expects unit volume to be about flat for the year, and net sales, excluding exchange effects, to be up two to four percent. Unit volume for January - March is forecasted to be flat or down two percent versus a strong prior year base period. Net sales excluding exchange effects are expected to grow in the low single digits. Double-digit earnings per share growth is expected for the quarter, with core net earnings per share in the On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 restructuring program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company will make a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations. Charges related to Organization 2005 consist primarily of costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities (including accelerated depreciation, asset write-downs and contract termination costs) and employee separation costs. During the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded expenses totaling $152 million before tax related to Organization 2005, as detailed in Organization 2005 July-December, 2000 Charges (before tax) For the July-December Period Beginning Quarter Quarter Charged Ending Reserves Charges New Total Cash Against Reserves at 6/30/00 Jul-Sep 00 Charges Charges Spent Assets 12/31/00 During October-December, 2000, Organization 2005 costs charged against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $81 million, while charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses and other expenses amounted to $71 million. Charges related to Organization 2005 are included in Corporate in the Company's segment disclosures. The underlying plant closures and consolidations will impact all regions and product segments. Planned plant closures and consolidations will not all be executed immediately due to either capacity or logistics constraints.

Approximately 70% of the $66 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in the October-December, 2000 quarter is concentrated in the paper segment and reflects the standardization of manufacturing and other work processes being undertaken in that segment. Most of the remaining balance is concentrated in the fabric and home care, food and beverage and beauty care segments.

2001-05-09,10-Q,0000080424-01-500008,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $893 million or $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Results included a $113 million after-tax charge related to the Organization 2005 restructuring program. Core net earnings, excluding Organization 2005 charges, were $1.01 billion for the quarter or $0.71 per diluted share. Core net earnings per diluted share increased 11 percent, primarily driven by pricing benefits and tax savings in the business units and divestiture gains. Net sales for the quarter were $9.51 billion, down three percent. Excluding a three percent unfavorable impact of exchange, due primarily to the euro and British pound, net sales were equal to year ago. Favorable pricing and mix effects offset a unit volume decline of three percent due to major new brand introductions in the base period. For the first nine months, reported net earnings were $3.24 billion, or $2.29 per diluted share. Results included charges of $318 million after-tax related to the Organization 2005 program. Excluding Organization 2005 charges, core net earnings were $3.56 billion, while core net earnings per diluted share were $2.52, five percent above the prior year. Net sales were up one percent to $29.66 billion, excluding a three percent unfavorable exchange rate effect. Unit volume decreased one percent. Gross margin was 45.6 percent for the current quarter compared to 45.5 percent in the same quarter of the prior year, and 46.1 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. Included in cost of products sold is a before-tax charge of $102 million related to Organization 2005. Excluding Organization 2005 costs, gross margin was 46.7 percent, slightly up versus the year ago quarter due to Operating margin was 13.7 percent for the quarter compared to 13.5 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 14.9 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $152 million before tax in Organization 2005 charges, operating margin was 15.3 percent, down slightly from the year ago period. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to the impact of the devaluation of Turkish lira assets, mitigated by a combination of pricing benefits and marketing For the nine-month period, gross margin was 46.4 percent, below the 46.9 percent reported in the same period a year ago. Excluding Organization 2005 charges of $246 million before tax, gross margin was 47.2 percent. Operating margin on a year-to-date basis was 16.2 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year. Without Organization 2005 charges of $411 million before tax, operating margin was 17.5 percent. The decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the gross margin decrease. The following provides additional perspective on the company's results by Fabric and home care delivered double-digit earnings growth. Net sales of $2.77 billion were down three percent excluding negative exchange of three percent. Volume declined three percent, due to heavy new brand activity in the base period. Net earnings grew 23 percent to $348 million, including the benefit of lower taxes, gains from divestitures and pricing in North America laundry. Western Europe laundry continues to face strong competition, although shares have begun to improve indicating progress in restoring price competitiveness. For the first nine months of the year, net sales decreased five percent on a two percent volume decline. Net earnings increased five percent, reflecting factors similar to those for the quarter. The paper segment achieved solid earnings progress during the quarter. The competitive environment kept volume flat, despite growth in baby care and in Latin America and Europe. Pricing actions and improved mix offset unfavorable exchange impacts. Net sales of $2.94 billion were up three percent, excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of three percent. Net earnings for the quarter grew eight percent to $236 million, as pricing actions particularly in tissues and towel and lower investment spending offset commodity-related cost On a year-to-date basis, net sales were down one percent on flat unit volume. Net earnings were up one percent. Beauty care net sales were $1.78 billion, down six percent. Excluding the four percent impact of unfavorable currencies, and the impact of divestitures, net sales were down one percent. Innovation on core brands - Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Olay - is growing share in the U.S., and beginning to expand to international markets. Volume was down two percent, excluding divestitures, due to the launch of Physique in the base period. Gross margin improvements and marketing cost efficiency helped deliver $243 million in net earnings, five percent growth over the prior year. For the first nine months of the year, net sales were down two percent, consistent with unit volume. Net earnings grew nine percent. Health care delivered net sales growth of two percent to $1.10 billion, despite flat unit volume, on a stronger mix of new oral care and pharmaceutical products, notably Actonel. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales grew five percent. Net earnings declined 10 percent to $91 million. Excluding the benefit of the Iams sell-in in the base period, health care earnings grew Year-to-date, volume increased 13 percent while net sales rose 10 percent, primarily from Iams growth and new products in oral care and pharmaceuticals. Net earnings increased six percent as growth from new products was partially offset by the high level of licensing and divestiture activity in the prior In food and beverage, net earnings grew to $67 million, a 34 percent increase due to global snacks price increases and heavy new initiative spending in the base period, primarily in coffee. Net sales of $938 million were down four percent. Excluding one percent unfavorable foreign exchange, and the divestiture of institutional shortening and oils in the quarter, net sales were flat. A favorable mix impact partially offset the eight percent volume decline. For the first nine months of the year, net sales decreased 10 percent with unit volume down nine percent. Net earnings were down nine percent primarily due to The Company has announced possible transactions that could materially affect future results of the food and beverage segment. The intended formation of a new entity to combine the snacks and juice business with the juice business of The Coca-Cola Company is expected to provide the strategic focus and capability to deliver future growth for these businesses. Additionally, the Company recently announced plans to explore strategic alternatives with respect to its retail shortening and oils and peanut butter businesses, including outright sale, joint venture or a swap for other consumer brands. The corporate segment includes both operating and non-operating items such as financing and investing activities, goodwill amortization, employee benefit costs, charges related to restructuring (including the Organization 2005 program), segment eliminations and other general corporate items. Based on the nature of the items, corporate results can vary significantly from period to period. Net earnings for the corporate segment declined nearly 50 percent in the quarter, excluding Organization 2005 charges, reflecting divestiture gains in the current year which were more than offset by increased interest expense and certain non-recurring items in the prior year. Net debt (total debt less cash) decreased $201 million since June 30, 2000, as increases in debt, primarily to fund the Company's ongoing share repurchase program, were more than offset by increases in operating cash flow. For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2001, cash generated from operating activities totaled $3.8 billion, up from $2.9 billion in the same period in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from improvements in working Acquisitions were down $2.8 billion versus the year ago period, which included the Iams Company and Recovery Engineering. Capital spending declined $165 million versus the year ago period, reflecting the Company's focus on improved The Company confirmed that it is comfortable with the range of analysts' estimates for core earnings per share growth for the quarter. Unit volume for April-June is forecasted to be flat to up two percent while net sales excluding exchange effects are expected to grow in the low single digits. On June 9, 1999, the Company announced an Organization 2005 restructuring program that is an integral part of the broader 2005 initiative, which includes a realignment of the organization structure, work processes and culture designed to accelerate growth by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes. These changes are intended to increase the Company's ability to innovate and bring initiatives to global markets more quickly. In order to implement the program's structural changes and achieve the benefits of faster growth, the Company is making a number of structural changes to both its administrative and manufacturing operations. During the quarter, the Company announced an acceleration and expansion of the Organization 2005 restructuring program designed to ensure competitive costs and enable accelerated growth. These actions will streamline the Company's cost structure by reducing overhead costs and by extending plans to reduce manufacturing costs. This is expected to be achieved by reducing staffing by an additional 9,600 jobs worldwide, or nine percent of the Company's workforce. About 40 percent will be in the U.S. and about 60 percent outside the U.S. Two-thirds of the reductions will come from non-manufacturing roles across all levels in the company; one-third will come from manufacturing projects. Manufacturing reductions will include both plant closures and further consolidation of production modules. Although the plans are not finalized, the Company expects the cost of this aspect of the program to be $1.4 billion after-tax, with the bulk of these costs to be incurred by June 30, 2002. The savings are expected to be $600-700 million after-tax annually by 2004, and will be incremental to the original Organization 2005 restructuring program. Additionally, the Company is continuing to review its business and new investments with the goal of more tightly focusing on its core business. While no decisions have been reached, it is possible that such additional costs could be $400-800 million after-tax. A final decision on this component of the Organization 2005 restructuring program is expected before the end of the fiscal Charges related to Organization 2005 are related to the initial program and consist primarily of costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities (including accelerated depreciation, asset write-downs and contract termination costs) and employee separation costs. During the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the Company recorded expenses totaling $152 million before tax related to Organization 2005, as detailed in the following table: Organization 2005 July, 2000-March, 2001 Charges (before tax) For the July-March Period Beginning Quarter Charged Ending Reserves Charges New Total Cash Against Reserves at 6/30/00 Jul-Dec 00 Charges Charges Spent Assets 3/31/01 During January-March, 2001, Organization 2005 costs charged against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $102 million, while charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses amounted to $50 million. Charges related to Organization 2005 are included in Corporate in the Company's segment disclosures. The underlying plant closures and consolidations will impact all regions and product segments. Planned plant closures and consolidations will not all be executed immediately due to either capacity or Employee separation charges in January-March, 2001 are associated with severance packages for approximately 550 people, representing primarily administrative employees in North America, Asia, and Europe. The predominantly voluntary packages are formula-driven, based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer in accordance with Company policy for such programs. On average, net enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 85% of total separations, as some terminations will be partially offset through increased enrollment at remaining sites. Of total separations expected through fiscal 2001, approximately half will take place in manufacturing with the balance in administrative functions. Separation costs related to manufacturing employees are included in cost of products sold, while those for administrative employees are reported in marketing, research and administrative expenses. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization and closures that will occur primarily over the next two years as a result of the Organization 2005 program. The Company has changed the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in an acceleration of depreciation. Approximately 70% of the $68 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in the January-March, 2001 quarter is concentrated in the paper segment and reflects the standardization of manufacturing and other work processes being undertaken in that segment. Most of the remaining balance is concentrated in the fabric and home care and beauty Charges for other costs related to Organization 2005 amounted to $31 million during the January-March, 2001 quarter, and consisted primarily of costs associated with relocation, training and other Organization 2005-related PART II.

2001-10-30,10-Q,0000080424-01-500074,"and Analysis The Company reported earnings of $1.10 billion or $0.79 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2001. Results included a $238 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the Company's restructuring initiative to streamline its organization structure and business portfolio. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $1.16 billion, including a $85 million after-tax Core net earnings were $1.34 billion for the quarter or $0.96 per diluted share. Core results exclude restructuring charges in both periods and $53 million after-tax or $0.04 per share of goodwill and intangible asset amortization in the prior period. In the first quarter, the Company adopted the new accounting rules for goodwill and other intangible assets, which prospectively eliminates a significant portion of amortization expense beginning July 1, 2001. Gross margin was 47.7 percent for the current quarter compared to 46.8 percent in the same quarter of the prior year, and 43.7 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. Included in cost of products sold is a $120 million before-tax restructuring charge. Excluding restructuring, gross margin was 48.8 percent, up from 47.4 percent in the year ago quarter due to lower material costs and other cost savings programs. Operating margin was 18.0 percent for the current quarter compared to 17.8 percent in the same quarter a year ago and 12.1 for the prior fiscal year. Excluding $310 million before tax in restructuring charges and the prior year impact of goodwill amortization, operating margin was 21.3 percent, up from 19.5 percent in the year ago period. Operating margin progress was driven by gross margin improvement, overhead cost reductions and marketing support efficiencies. The following provides additional perspective on the Company's results by Fabric and home care's focus on leadership brands and improved fundamentals is beginning to show promising results in key markets. However, prior year comparisons are difficult due to a very high base that included significant customer buying in advance of a price increase in North America laundry. Unit volume decreased two percent versus the prior year comparison, despite growth in Western Europe and developing markets. Excluding two percent negative foreign exchange and a one percent impact of divestitures in the prior year, net sales of $2.88 billion were down three percent. Net earnings were down 10 percent to $450 million versus year ago, primarily due to lower sales and minor brand divestitures in the prior year. BABY, FEMININE AND FAMILY CARE The baby, feminine and family care segment generated earnings growth as the business responds to improved consumer value propositions. Unit volume grew four percent, driven by family care. Net sales of $3.00 billion were up two percent excluding a three percent unfavorable exchange impact. Net earnings for the quarter increased four percent to $342 million due to lower commodity costs and other cost structure improvements. In baby care, net sales were up behind strength in Baby Wipes and double-digit growth in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and in China. In family care, sales were up strongly as the North American business continues to respond to an improved value Beauty care results demonstrate the benefit of portfolio shifts into higher margin products behind leadership innovation. Unit volume was down slightly due to Clearasil divestiture impacts; however, earnings growth was outstanding. Net sales were $1.77 billion, comparable to the prior year after excluding a three percent impact of unfavorable currencies and a two percent impact of divestitures. Net earnings grew 22 percent to $326 million, primarily due to marketing support efficiencies behind growing businesses and lower launch expenditure, coupled with disciplined cost management. Additionally, the majority of key markets achieved double-digit earnings progress, with Latin America providing the strongest growth behind the successful restages of Pantene Health care delivered double-digit growth behind the sustained development of initiative programs on leading brands. Unit volume was up 19 percent driven by excellent results in oral care, Iams pet health and nutrition, and pharmaceuticals. Net sales grew 21 percent to $1.18 billion, excluding a two percent unfavorable exchange impact. Net earnings increased 73 percent to $140 million, reflecting the benefit of high margin brands driving growth. In oral care, Spinbrush is vying for value share leadership in the U.S. electric toothbrush market, while Whitestrips achieved $100 million in net sales since its launch in May 2001. Iams continues to grow behind initiatives and channel expansion. Pharmaceuticals continued growth was driven by Actonel, which built prescription share in the United States, Canada and key European markets. Food and beverage achieved solid earnings progress during the quarter. Excluding divestitures, unit volume declined two percent. Net sales were $955 million, down from the prior year level of $1.05 billion. The decrease is attributable to divestitures, unfavorable foreign exchange impact and commodity-related pricing actions in coffee. Importantly, net earnings grew to $99 million, a 32 percent increase, behind heightened cost savings efforts in juice and coffee. The corporate segment, which contains both operating and non-operating items is not included in the business results. The change in net earnings for the corporate segment was driven by increased restructuring charges due to the expansion of the program announced last fiscal year. Net debt (total debt less cash) increased $32.3 million since June 30, 2001, as increases in debt, primarily to fund the Company's ongoing share repurchase program, were partially offset by increases in operating cash flow. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2001, cash generated from operating activities totaled $1.3 billion, slightly up from $1.1 billion in the same period in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from improvements RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE Beginning in 1999 - concurrent with the Company's reorganization into product-based global business units - the Company initiated its Organization 2005 restructuring program. The program was expanded in March, 2001 to deliver further cost reductions through reduced overhead, further manufacturing consolidations, and discontinuation of under-performing businesses and Costs to be incurred include separation related expenses, asset write-downs or accelerated depreciation, results of certain initiatives being discontinued and other costs directly related to the restructuring effort. These costs are reported in the corporate segment for management and external reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the Company recorded charges totaling $310 million before tax ($238 million after tax) related to restructuring. The charges to cost of products sold amounted to $120 million before tax and charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses amounted to $214 million before tax. Business results from certain initiatives being discontinued included $24 million before tax of net sales which are nearly offset by related costs in the current period restructuring charges. Further details are shown in the following table: Restructuring Program July-September, 2001 Charges (before tax) Beginning Current Charged Ending Reserves Quarter Cash Against Reserves at 6/30/01 Charges Spent Assets 9/30/01 Employee separation charges of $212 million before tax in July - September, 2001 are associated with severance packages for approximately 3,000 people. The packages are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling, research and administrative positions. The charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs, which totaled $63 million before tax in the first quarter, are primarily related to manufacturing operations. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. Charges for asset write-downs relate to the establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. Other costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program amounted to $35 million before tax during the July - September, 2001 quarter. These were primarily for relocation, training, establishment of global business services and results from discontinued initiatives. There are two additional areas for which additional discussion is provided: accounting for goodwill and intangible amortization, and disclosure of Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement Nos. 141 and 142, Business Combinations and Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FASB Statement No. 141 requires a fundamentally different approach to accounting for business combinations, requiring that virtually all business combinations be accounted for as acquisitions at fair value. The former pooling of interests method has been eliminated. These rules will be applicable to all subsequent acquisitions, including the planned acquisition of Clairol. FASB Statement No. 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets. Rather, goodwill and intangibles not subject to amortization will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair values with their recorded amounts. The impact of adopting these new requirements is discussed further in Footnote 4. Annually the Company discloses advertising expense, which is a component of its marketing, research and administrative expense. This amount reflects primarily media and media-related costs. In the prior year disclosure a misclassification occurred. For the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 the correct amounts of advertising expense were: $3,612, $3,793, and $3,639, respectively. As a percent of net sales, this would be 9.2%, 9.5% and 9.6% for 2001, 2000, and 1999. This reclassification only affects the advertising expense disclosure and has no effect on total marketing, research and administrative expense, operating PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",1602

2002-02-05,10-Q,0000080424-02-000004,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.30 billion or $0.93 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2001. Results included a $146 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the Company's streamlining of operations and business portfolio. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $1.19 billion, including a $120 million after-tax restructuring charge. Core net earnings were $1.03 per share or $1.45 billion for the current quarter, compared to $0.97 per share or $1.37 billion in the year ago quarter. These results exclude restructuring charges in both periods. Additionally, the year ago quarter excludes $55 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share, for amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets that are not required in the current Net sales were $10.40 billion, up two percent versus year-ago. Unit volume grew five percent versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth in the health and beauty care businesses. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased four percent. Pricing had a two percent negative impact on sales in the quarter, consistent with plans to achieve more competitive levels and address the impacts of commodity prices. Foreign exchange had a negative one percent impact on net sales. Business segment after tax earnings were up 12 percent, reflecting increased volume and improved manufacturing costs. Beauty care and fabric and home care generated two-thirds of the net earnings growth. For the first six months, reported net earnings were $2.40 billion, or $1.71 per share. Results included a $384 million after-tax charge related to the restructuring program. Excluding restructuring charges and the prior year amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles, core net earnings were $2.79 billion in 2001 and $2.66 billion in 2000. Core net earnings per share grew five percent to $1.99 in the current year. Net sales were up two percent, excluding a two percent negative foreign exchange impact. Gross margin was 48.7 percent for the current quarter, compared to 46.8 percent in the same quarter of the prior year, and 43.7 percent for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. This margin progress reflects lower manufacturing costs and the benefits of previous restructuring actions. Cost of products sold includes an $82 million before-tax restructuring charge. Excluding restructuring costs, gross margin was 49.4 percent, compared to 47.6 percent in the year ago quarter. Operating margin was 17.9 percent for the quarter, compared to 16.8 percent in the same quarter year ago, and 12.1 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding restructuring charges and amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the year ago quarter, operating margin grew to 19.8 percent from 18.9 percent. Operating margin progress was driven by gross margin improvement. Marketing, research and administrative costs reflect good progress on base savings programs, but increased due to costs associated with the integration of Clairol and increased investments in health care. Fabric and home care results improved during the second quarter, with four percent volume growth behind strength in Europe fabric care and improved performance in North America home care. Net sales were $2.97 billion, up one percent, as minor pricing and mix impacts in Western Europe and Asia partially offset increased volume. Net earnings were $437 million, up 12 percent, due to disciplined cost management led by North America and Western Europe and increased marketing support efficiencies. Year-to-date, unit volume reflected a one percent increase while net sales declined three percent. Net earnings were flat versus year ago. BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE Baby, feminine and family care reflected solid results. Unit volume increased three percent behind strong family care volume, particularly on Bounty(R) in North America and baby care's Pamper's Wipes(R). Net sales were $3.03 billion, down one percent, as commodity-driven price moves in family care and targeted pricing actions in baby care more than offset volume growth. Earnings were $335 million, up 14 percent, behind a strong focus on cost efficiencies including For the first six months of the year, unit volume increased three percent. Net sales declined one percent while earnings grew eight percent. Beauty care continued to deliver strong results led by progress in hair care across all regions. Unit volume increased 15 percent driven by the Clairol acquisition. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume was up three percent. Net sales were $2.06 billion, up 13 percent, excluding a two percent negative exchange impact, as strength in hair care - driven by Pantene(R), Head & Shoulders(R) and Clairol - was partially offset by price adjustments in North America's personal cleansing category. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, net sales were up two percent. Net earnings were $334 million, up 17 percent versus last year despite increased costs associated with the integration of Clairol. This earnings increase was driven by a continued focus on cost control and higher launch costs in the base period. For the first six months of the fiscal year, unit volume was up seven percent. Net sales increased three percent while net earnings grew 19 percent. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume increased two percent and net sales declined one percent during this six month period. Health care posted strong results, with double-digit volume and sales growth, led by oral care and pharmaceuticals. Unit volume increased 15 percent driven by strong sales of Actonel(R) and Crest(R) (particularly White Strips(R) and Spinbrush(R)). Net sales grew 17 percent to $1.34 billion behind volume growth and positive mix effects. Crest joined the ranks of P&G's billion dollar brands, achieving $1.0 billion in sales in calendar year 2001. Net earnings were $172 million, up five percent, as investments behind oral care initiatives and pharmaceutical development partially offset gains due to volume. On a year-to-date basis, unit volume was up 17 percent and net sales were up 18 percent. Net earnings grew 27 percent behind these strong volume and net sales Net earnings in food and beverage increased despite a divestiture in the prior year and commodity-related pricing actions. Net sales declined 11 percent to $1.05 billion on a nine percent unit volume decline. Excluding the divestiture impacts, unit volume was down five percent reflecting an increased competitive merchandising environment. Pricing also contributed to decreased sales as we continued to reflect lower green coffee costs into Folgers(R) pricing. Net earnings were $126 million, up two percent, behind restructuring savings in juice and coffee and other cost savings efforts offset by lower volumes. For the first half of the year, unit volume was down eight percent while net sales were down ten percent and net earnings grew 13 percent. The corporate segment contains both operating and non-operating items that are not included in the business results. The comparability of corporate results is affected by a reduction in divestiture gains and higher restructuring costs in the current year. These more than offset the benefit from the accounting change to no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangibles, effective in the current FINANCIAL CONDITION & LIQUIDITY For the six-month period ended December 31, 2001, cash generated from operating activities totaled $3.2 billion, up $0.9 billion from the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to changes in working capital levels. Progress on accounts receivable continues while inventory levels are up slightly, primarily in food and beverage and baby, feminine and family care. This reflects both volume trends and initiative activity. Accounts payable and accruals delivered a significant amount of cash flow improvement, reflecting the timing of payments for accruals. Accounts payable were relatively stable. Investing activities and financing activities reflect the impacts of the Clairol acquisition and associated financing. Initial funding for the acquisition was primarily achieved with short-term debt. Importantly, capital spending declined $583 million, reflecting increased efficiencies across multiple business units primarily in North America. The decline in proceeds from asset sales is consistent with reduced divestitures gains.

2002-05-02,10-Q,0000080424-02-000020,"and Analysis The Company reported net earnings of $1.04 billion or $0.74 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2002. Results included a $147 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the Company's streamlining of operations and business portfolio. This restructuring charge included employee separation costs of $51 million before tax and asset-related charges of $83 million before tax. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $893 million, including a $113 million after-tax restructuring charge. Core net earnings were $0.84 per share or $1.19 billion for the current quarter, compared to $0.75 per share or $1.06 billion in the year ago quarter. These results exclude restructuring charges in both periods. Additionally, the year ago quarter excludes $56 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share, for amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets that are not required in the current Net sales were $9.90 billion, up four percent versus year ago. Unit volume grew ten percent versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth in the health and beauty care businesses and strong progress in fabric and home care. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased six percent. Pricing and mix had a three percent negative impact on sales in the quarter, due to the pass through of lower commodity costs, structural price adjustments in fabric and baby care and mix effects. Foreign exchange had a negative three percent impact For the first nine months, reported net earnings were $3.44 billion, or $2.45 per share. Results included a $531 million after-tax charge related to the restructuring program. This restructuring charge includes employee separation costs of $348 million before tax and asset-related charges of $224 million before tax. Excluding restructuring charges and the prior year amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles, core net earnings were $3.97 billion in 2002 and $3.72 billion in 2001. Core net earnings per share grew seven percent to $2.83 in the current year. Net sales for the first nine months were $30.1 billion, up three percent, excluding a two percent negative foreign exchange Gross margin was 48.8 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2002, compared to 45.6 percent in the same quarter of the prior year. Excluding restructuring costs, gross margin was 49.8 percent, compared to 46.7 percent in the year ago quarter. This margin progress reflects the benefits of restructuring actions, lower material costs and benefits from improved corporate portfolio mix. Cost of products sold includes a $107 million before-tax restructuring charge. Operating margin was 16.7 percent for the quarter, compared to 13.7 percent in the same quarter year ago, and 12.1 percent for the prior fiscal year. Excluding restructuring charges and amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the year ago quarter, operating margin grew to 18.7 percent from 15.9 percent. Operating margin progress was driven by gross margin improvement. Marketing, research and administrative costs reflect continued progress from restructuring, but increased due to costs associated with the integration of Clairol and increased marketing investments. Fabric and home care delivered excellent results, with six percent volume growth behind strength in North America. Net sales were $2.84 billion, up two percent, as pricing adjustments in Western Europe and Latin America partially offset increased volume. Net earnings were $472 million, up 36 percent, due to a continued focus on disciplined cost management led by North America and Western Year-to-date, unit volume reflected a two percent increase while net sales declined one percent. Net earnings increased 10 percent versus year ago. BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE Baby, feminine and family care reflected solid earnings growth. Unit volume increased four percent behind strong North America family care volume and strong Pamper's(R) growth. Net sales were $2.90 billion, down one percent, as volume growth partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and pricing adjustments to improve consumer value, including commodity-driven price moves. Earnings were $263 million, up 11 percent, including a non-operating gain from a licensing transaction with an unconsolidated joint venture. Excluding this one-time gain, earnings would have been up four percent, reflecting gross margin improvement from manufacturing projects and commodity price reductions that funded increased marketing investment. For the first nine months of the year, unit volume increased four percent. Net sales declined one percent while earnings grew nine percent. Beauty care posted strong results with double-digit volume, sales and earnings growth led by hair care and fine fragrances. Unit volume increased 28 percent driven by the Clairol acquisition. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume was up four percent behind hair care. Net sales were $2.11 billion, up 18 percent. Volume growth was partially offset by mix impacts driven by the Clairol acquisition and negative foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, net sales were up one percent versus year ago. Net earnings were $269 million, up 11 percent versus last year. The relationship between earnings and top-line growth reflects mix effects from the Clairol acquisition. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, unit volume was up 14 percent (up three percent excluding acquisitions and divestitures). Net sales increased eight percent while net earnings grew 17 percent. Health care continued to deliver strong results, as unit volume increased 16 percent, driven by strength in oral care, pharmaceuticals and pet health and nutrition. Net sales grew 11 percent to $1.22 billion behind strength in Crest Whitestrips and Spinbrush. Net earnings were $124 million, up 36 percent, reflecting volume and sales growth of high margin items, which has funded increased marketing investments. On a year-to-date basis, unit volume was up 17 percent and net sales were up 15 percent. Net earnings grew 30 percent behind these strong volume and net sales Net earnings in food and beverage increased behind broad-based cost reductions. Unit volume is showing improvement after a slow start to the fiscal year but was down one percent. Net sales declined six percent to $879 million as Folgers(R) pricing continued to reflect lower green coffee costs. Net earnings were $79 For the first nine months of the year, unit volume was down six percent (down three percent excluding acquisitions and divestitures) while net sales were down nine percent and net earnings grew 14 percent. The corporate segment contains both operating and non-operating items that are not included in the business results. The comparability of corporate results is affected by a reduction in divestiture gains and higher restructuring costs in the current year. These more than offset the benefit from the accounting change to no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangibles, effective in the current For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2002, cash generated from operating activities totaled $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from the same period in the prior year. Combined with earnings growth, this year-over-year increase reflects the benefit of a non-recurring shift in payment timing on certain operating accruals. Capital expenditures are down significantly versus prior year ($0.7 billion) achieving our long-term six percent of sales target several quarters ahead of expectations. This reflects increased efficiencies across multiple business units, primarily in North America. Asset sale proceeds from divestitures are down from the prior year due to larger divestitures last year (Clearasil, Spic & Span, Brooklands), generating a year- over-year cash decrease of $0.6 billion. Acquisitions in the current year reflect primarily the purchase of Clairol, which resulted in a year-over-year decline in cash partially offset by an increase in short-term debt. The Company maintains share repurchase programs, which authorize the purchase of shares on the open market to mitigate the dilutive impact of employee compensation programs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2002, the purchase of treasury shares was $0.4 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the same period in the prior year. This temporary decline was primarily driven by cash requirements for the Clairol acquisition. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE Concurrent with the Company's reorganization into product-based global business units, a multi-year restructuring program was initiated in 1999. The program will deliver cost reductions through reduced overhead, manufacturing consolidations, operational streamlining and discontinuation of under-performing businesses and initiatives. Restructuring charges include separation-related expenses, asset write-downs or accelerated depreciation, costs relating to certain discontinued initiatives and other costs directly related to the restructuring effort. These costs are reported in the corporate segment for management and external reporting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, the Company recorded charges totaling $191 million before tax ($147 million after tax) related to restructuring, as detailed in the following table: RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM JULY, 2001 - MARCH, 2002 CHARGES (BEFORE TAX) Beginning Quarters Current Applied Ending Reserves Charges Quarter Total Cash Against Reserves At 6/30/01 Jul-Dec 01 Charges Charges Spent Assets 3/31/02 During January - March 2002, restructuring charges against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $107 million before tax and charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses amounted to $99 million before tax. In addition, the Company had $15 million of net sales from initiatives being discontinued, which are reflected in corporate. Employee separation charges in January - March 2002 are associated with severance packages for approximately 1,000 people. The packages are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling, research and administrative positions. The charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs, which totaled $76 million before tax in the quarter ended March 31, 2002, are primarily related to manufacturing operations. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. Charges for asset write-downs relate to the establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. Additionally, asset write-downs include certain manufacturing assets that are expected to operate at levels significantly below their planned capacity. The projected cash flows from such assets over their remaining useful lives were no longer estimated to be greater than their current carrying values; therefore, they were written down to estimated fair value, generally determined by reference to discounted expected future cash flows. Such charges represented $15 million before tax in this quarter. Other costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program amounted to $64 million before tax during January - March, 2002. These were primarily for relocation, training, establishment of global business services and results from discontinued initiatives. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION",1786

For a discussion of key factors that could impact and must be managed by the Company, refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis section in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The Company reported net earnings of $1.46 billion or $1.04 diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Results included a $113 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the program to streamline the Company's operations and business portfolio. This restructuring program charge included employee separation costs of $52 million before tax and asset-related charges of $62 million before tax. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $1.10 billion or $0.79 diluted net earnings per share, including a $238 million after-tax restructuring charge. The restructuring charge for the year ago quarter include employee separation costs of $212 million before tax and asset-related charges of $69 million before tax. Core net earnings were $1.58 billion or $1.12 diluted net earnings per share for the current quarter, compared to $1.34 billion or $0.96 core diluted net earnings per share in the year ago quarter. These results exclude restructuring program charges in both periods. Net sales were $10.80 billion, up eleven percent versus the year ago quarter. Unit volume grew thirteen percent versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth in the fabric and home care, health care and beauty care businesses. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased ten percent. Sales trailed volume growth as a three-percent negative pricing and mix impact was partially offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of one percent. The pricing and mix impact was a function of the following primary effects: the pass through of lower commodity costs to consumers in coffee and tissue and structural price adjustments in baby care; negative mix impacts in beauty care, primarily related to Clairol; and continuing strong growth of the Company's developing market businesses which typically have a lower sales rate per unit and growth in mid-tier laundry brands. Gross margin was 49.2 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, compared to 47.7 percent in the same quarter of the prior year. Cost of products sold includes a $83 million before-tax charge related to the restructuring program. Excluding restructuring costs, gross margin was 50.0 percent, compared to 48.8 percent in the year ago quarter. This gross margin progress reflects the benefits from improved corporate portfolio mix, ongoing base business and restructuring savings and lower material costs. Operating margin was 20.2 percent for the quarter, compared to 18.0 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges, core operating margin increased to 21.6 percent from 21.3 percent, as gross margin improvement was offset by increased core marketing, research, administrative and other (MRA&O) costs. Core MRA&O as a percent of sales increased to 28.4 percent from 27.5 percent in the same quarter a year ago, reflecting increased marketing investments and investments in pharmaceuticals for clinical trials for our ongoing feminine testosterone research and milestone payments for our diabetes product research per our contractual agreements, partially offset by continued progress from the Company's restructuring program. Non-operating income increased $81 million, which includes the gain from the divestiture of the non strategic elements of the Company's Vicks business in As discussed in Note 3, segments have been restated for recent management and Fabric and home care delivered eleven percent volume growth reflecting innovation across all brands. Net sales were $3.13 billion, up nine percent, including a positive one percent foreign exchange impact. Sales trailed volume growth primarily due to strong performance on mid-tier brands and in developing markets, which resulted in a negative sales mix impact. Net earnings were $547 million, up 22 percent, reflecting higher volumes and a strong cost management focus. Operating margin expansion was achieved through lower material prices and a continued focus on base business savings projects, which funded increased All regions posted double-digit volume increases in fabric care except Latin America, where markets are contracting reflecting the tough economic environment and sharp currency erosion. However, the Company maintained laundry category share leadership in Latin America and shares are up versus prior year. Baby and family care delivered unit volume growth of six percent behind strength in baby care in North America and Western Europe. Net sales were $2.43 billion, up five percent, as pricing adjustments to reflect lower commodity costs and improved consumer value on Luvs were partially offset by a positive one percent foreign exchange impact and product mix toward premium tier diapers and pants. Earnings were $241 million, up eight percent, reflecting sales growth, particularly in premium tier diapers, and manufacturing and restructuring cost Despite four percent volume growth in family care, shares were down slightly due to aggressive competitive promotional spending - well beyond levels associated with passing on lower pulp prices to consumers. The Company has responded to these actions, but is anticipating a reversal of the spending trends as pulp costs start to increase. Baby care volume grew double-digits in both North America and Western Europe, leading to strong share growth in the quarter driven by the Pampers Baby Stages initiative. Beauty care posted double-digit volume, sales and earnings growth. Unit volume increased 32 percent led by the Clairol acquisition. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume was up ten percent behind strength in hair care and fine fragrances. The hair care business was particularly strong, with North America delivering broad-based volume progress across the hair care portfolio. Western Europe and China hair care were also notably strong, where both Pantene and Head & Shoulders delivered excellent volume growth. Feminine care volume grew in the high single digits after several quarters of declines, with the U.S. delivering double-digit volume growth. Net sales were $3.12 billion, up 27 percent including a two percent positive foreign exchange impact. Volume growth was partially offset by mix impacts driven by the Clairol business. Net earnings were $548 million, up 23 percent versus last year as manufacturing cost reductions were partially offset by increased marketing investments, primarily in advertising. Health care continued to deliver strong results. Unit volume increased 19 percent, driven by strength in pharmaceuticals, behind strong Actonel once-a-week results, and oral care. Net sales grew 20 percent to $1.41 billion, including a positive one percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings for health care were $196 million, up 40 percent, reflecting volume and sales growth of high margin items, such as Crest Whitestrips and Actonel. This growth is after the funding of increased clinical and milestone costs in pharmaceuticals. The oral care business continued to grow strongly in all major tooth care segments: dentifrice, toothbrushes and whitening systems. Crest Whitestrips results have been very strong, with volume double the prior year. Recently, the Company has responded to a competitive entry into the tooth whitening category by announcing a price decline, of approximately 30%, effective in October 2002. Additionally, the expected FDA approval timing on Prilosec OTC has moved to the fall of 2003. This new timeline has no material impact to the Company's expected results for the current fiscal year. Snacks and beverages delivered good results as unit volume increased four percent behind strength in the snacks businesses offset by softness in beverages. Net sales grew three percent to $822 million, including a two percent positive foreign exchange impact. Results reflect the Folgers' pricing response to aggressive competitive pricing activity in the marketplace and continued lower green coffee costs. Snacks delivered double-digit volume growth, with progress in both Pringles and Torengos. Net earnings grew strongly, up 23 percent to $91 million, driven by volume growth and a continued focus on cost The corporate segment contains both operating and non-operating items that are not included in the business results. Current year results reflect increased divestiture gains and lower restructuring costs. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, cash generated from operating activities totaled $2.01 billion. Earnings, adjusted for non-cash charges, are the primary driver of operating cash flow and the $0.68 billion increase from the first quarter of last year. Working capital increased slightly from June 30. Days sales outstanding improved two days for receivables and seven days for inventory days on hand versus the first quarter of last year. Accounts payable and other accruals decreased, reflecting a reduction in days outstanding for trade payables and normal timing differences for other accruals. The remaining increase versus the prior year was driven by changes in other operating assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, and a reduction in equity investments Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, for the first quarter was $1.73 billion, representing a $0.76 billion increase over the same period last year. In addition to earnings growth, this increase reflects reduced capital spending levels in the quarter. The Company anticipates that this capital spending rate will increase through the year, but the fiscal year average will be in line with the revised target of below five percent of Investing activities used $195 million of cash in the current year compared to $362 million in the previous year. This generated a $167 million net cash increase versus the prior year, primarily attributable to $53 million higher divestiture proceeds, reduced capital spending of $71 million and the absence of acquisition activity in the quarter. Divestiture proceeds in the quarter were from the Vicks throat drop business in Japan. The prior year acquisition activity relates primarily to Jean Patou. Financing activities used $524 million of cash for the current fiscal year versus a net use of $389 million in the prior year quarter. The largest driver of this $135 million difference is increased purchase of treasury shares, reflecting a return of the share repurchase program to historical levels. We continue negotiations regarding the potential outsourcing of certain administrative and other business support services. At this time, no final decisions have been made. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of its operations into product-based global business units, the Company initiated a multi-year restructuring program. The program is designed to accelerate growth and deliver cost reductions by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes and discontinuing under-performing businesses and initiatives. Technology improvements as well as standardization of manufacturing and other work processes allow the Company to streamline operations, resulting in the consolidation of manufacturing activity and various business processes. Costs to be incurred include separation related costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the restructuring During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded charges totaling $151 million before tax ($113 million after tax) related to its restructuring program, as detailed in the following table. In addition, the Company continues to execute similar projects as part of ongoing operations. Costs for these projects are included in core earnings. Restructuring Program July - September, 2002 Charges (before tax) Beginning Current Applied Ending Reserves Quarter Cash Against Reserves 6/30/02 Charges Spent Assets 9/30/02 Accelerated depreciation - 33 - 33 - During July - September 2002, restructuring charges against the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $83 million before tax and charges included in marketing, research and administrative expenses amounted to $63 million before tax. In addition, the Company had $5 million of net sales reductions from initiatives being discontinued, which are reflected in corporate. Employee separation charges in July - September 2002 are associated with severance packages for approximately 900 people. The packages are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling, research and administrative positions. The charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs, which totaled $58 million before tax in the quarter ended September 30, 2002, are primarily related to manufacturing operations. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. Charges for asset write-downs relate to the establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. Other costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program amounted to $41 million before tax during July - September 2002. These were primarily for relocation, training, establishment of global business services and results from discontinued initiatives.",2144

2003-01-29,10-Q,0000080424-03-000004,"and Analysis Despite continuing softness in the global economy the Company delivered sales and earnings growth for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. Most businesses in Latin America suffered declines in volume, sales and earnings, which had a modest dampening effect on the Company. Going forward, economic and political uncertainties in markets such as Latin America and the Middle East could affect results. For a discussion of key factors that could impact and must be managed by the Company, refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis section in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The Company reported net earnings of $1.49 billion or $1.06 diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. Results included a $98 million ($0.07 per share) after-tax restructuring charge related to the Company's program to streamline operations and its business portfolio. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $1.30 billion or $0.93 per share, including a $146 million ($0.10 per share) after-tax restructuring charge. Core net earnings, which exclude restructuring charges, grew ten percent to $1.59 billion or $1.13 per share for the quarter. On a per share basis, core earnings grew ten percent to $1.13. In the year ago period, core net earnings were $1.45 billion or $1.03 per share. Net sales were $11.01 billion, up six percent versus the year ago quarter. Unit volume grew eight percent versus the prior year, including double-digit growth in the health care and beauty care businesses and eight percent growth in fabric and home care and baby and family care. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased seven percent. Sales trailed volume growth as strategic pricing investments and a negative mix impact were partially offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of one percent. The foreign exchange impact represents the benefit of the Euro offset by Latin American devaluations. The pricing and mix impacts were a function of the following primary effects: promotional investments on baby and family care in the U.S., the pricing adjustments taken on Crest Whitestrips following competitive entries and portfolio extension strategies in the hair care business. Gross margin was 50.1 percent for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared to 48.7 percent in the same quarter of the prior year, an increase of 140 basis points. Core gross margin also increased 140 basis points to 50.8 percent from 49.4 percent in the prior year. Core gross margin excludes before-tax charges in cost of products sold related to the restructuring program of $84 million in the current year and $82 million in the prior year. Core gross margin has expanded by over 100 basis points in each of the last six quarters creating a challenging base for future period growth comparisons. The current quarter improvement was primarily driven by base business savings, which includes both systemic material price improvements and volume benefits. Restructuring program savings and improved margin mix also contributed. Marketing, Research, Administrative, and Other costs (MRA&O), as a percent of sales, decreased from 30.8 percent in the prior year to 29.7 percent in the current year, an improvement of 110 basis points. Core MRA&O, which excludes restructuring costs of $57 million in the current year and $121 million in the prior year, decreased from 29.6 percent of sales in the prior year to 29.2 percent in the current year. These trends reflect reductions in overhead costs, partially offset by increased marketing spending, primarily in beauty care. Operating margin was 20.4 percent for the quarter, compared to 17.9 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding before tax net restructuring charges in the current and prior year of $132 million and $189 million, core operating margin increased to 21.6 percent from 19.8 percent, due to the gross margin and MRA&O improvements discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Non-operating income decreased $126 million, primarily due to the prior year gain from the divestiture of the Comet business. Fabric and home care delivered eight percent unit volume growth. This was broad-based, with strong growth across most regions - lead by double-digit growth in the developing markets. Net sales were $3.10 billion, up five percent. Sales trailed volume growth due to pricing and mix impacts. The pricing actions included the restage of certain mid-tier brands and certain targeted actions to sharpen consumer value in key markets. Mix impacts in laundry were driven by the growth of mid-tier brands in Western Europe and North America, larger sizes in Western Europe and growth in developing markets. Net earnings were $514 million, up 18 percent, behind volume growth and gross margin expansion. Gross margin expansion was achieved through lower material prices and a continued focus on base business savings projects, which funded increased Baby and family care delivered unit volume growth of eight percent behind strength in both family care and baby care, driven primarily by the Baby Stages of Development initiative, Charmin in the U.S., Western Europe and Mexico and U.S. Bounty. Net sales were $2.53 billion, up seven percent, including a one percent positive impact from foreign exchange. Sales trailed volume due primarily to pricing adjustments in response to competitive activity in both the baby and family care segments, which more than offset positive mix behind growth in premium tier diapers. Earnings were $276 million, up twenty-one percent, reflecting volume growth and cost savings, including benefits from previous Beauty care posted double-digit volume, sales and earnings growth, led by hair care and fine fragrances. Unit volume increased 14 percent driven by the Clairol acquisition, which was annualized in mid-November. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume was up six percent behind hair care, as Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Pert and Rejoice all posted volume gains on a global basis. Additionally, the fine fragrances business increased volume 30 percent. Feminine care volume was up two percent, which follows last quarter's strong shipments that included pipeline fill for the Tampax Pearl initiative. Beauty care net sales were $3.00 billion, up 10 percent, including a one percent positive foreign exchange impact. Volume growth was partially offset by mix impacts driven by the Clairol business and value driven pricing investments behind the repositioning of the hair care portfolio into mid-tier brands, which more than offset devaluation driven pricing actions in Latin America. Net earnings were $507 million, up 15 percent versus last year driven primarily by volume growth and reduced overheads, partially offset by increased marketing Health care delivered double-digit unit volume, sales and earnings growth. Unit volume increased 18 percent, driven by results in oral care, pharmaceuticals and pet health and nutrition. Net sales grew 17 percent to $1.57 billion, including a positive one percent foreign exchange impact, which partially offset pricing investments. Despite an October pricing adjustment, Crest Whitestrips still delivered volume and sales growth relative to the prior year. Actonel, the Company's drug for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, surpassed $500 million in annual sales in calendar year 2002. Net earnings for health care were $253 million, up 47 percent, reflecting volume growth and improved mix, driven by the continued trend toward high-margin products, partially offset by the funding of increased marketing investments. Snacks and beverages delivered mixed results. Unit volume declined one percent, as an increase in coffee was offset by declines in the snacks and juice businesses. Net sales grew one percent to $881 million, including a two percent positive foreign exchange impact. Net earnings grew 15 percent to $110 million, behind positive mix and cost savings from operating efficiencies and restructuring, which more than offset increased marketing investments. The corporate segment contains both operating and non-operating items that are not included in the business results. Current quarter results reflect decreased divestiture gains and lower restructuring costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2002, cash generated from operating activities totaled $4.33 billion. Earnings, adjusted for non-cash charges, increased $555 million and are a key driver of operating cash flow and the $1.15 billion increase from the first half of last year. Working capital increased slightly from June 30. Receivables days sales outstanding and inventory days on hand both improved versus the same period last year. Accounts payable and other accruals decreased cash year-over-year, reflecting a decrease in taxes payable that reflects a return to historical levels, a reduction in days outstanding for trade payables and normal timing differences for other accruals. The remaining increase in operating cash flow versus the prior year was driven by changes in other operating assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, and a reduction in investments in non-consolidated entities for dividends received. Free cash flow for the first half of the year, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $3.71 billion, representing a $1.20 billion increase over the same period last year. This increase reflects the increase in operating cash flow discussed in the preceding paragraph and reduced capital spending levels in the quarter. The Company anticipates that this capital spending rate may increase through the year, but the fiscal year average will be below the Company's revised target of below five percent of sales. Investing activities used $507 million of cash year to date compared to $5.48 billion in the comparable prior year period, which included the Clairol acquisition during the October-December quarter. There has been no significant acquisition activity in the current year. This generated a $4.98 billion net cash increase versus the prior year. Divestiture proceeds in the current year include the Vicks throat drop business in Japan, certain Clairol small brands and a paper divestiture in China. Prior year divestitures included Comet and PUR Financing activities used $2.15 billion of cash for the current fiscal year versus a source of $3.19 billion in the first half of the prior year. The largest driver of this $5.34 billion difference is the prior year issuance of short-term debt to finance the Clairol acquisition. Treasury share purchases used more cash in the current year, reflecting lower repurchase activity in the prior year base period driven by cash needs for the Clairol acquisition. Share repurchase in the current year reflects a return to historical levels. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of its operations into product-based global business units, the Company initiated a multi-year restructuring program. The program was designed to accelerate growth and deliver cost reductions by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes and discontinuing under-performing businesses and initiatives. Technology improvements as well as standardization of manufacturing and other work processes allow the Company to streamline operations, resulting in the consolidation of manufacturing activity and various business processes. Costs to be incurred include separation related costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the restructuring During the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded charges totaling $132 million before tax ($98 million after tax) related to its restructuring program, as detailed in the following table. In addition, the Company continues to execute similar projects as part of ongoing operations. Costs for these projects are included in core earnings. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM JULY - DECEMBER, 2002 CHARGES (BEFORE TAX) Beginning Quarter Current Applied Ending Reserves Charges Quarter Total Cash Against Reserves 6/30/02 Jul-Sep 02 Charges Charges Spent Assets 12/31/02 During October - December 2002, restructuring charges included in the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $84 million before tax and charges included in MRA&O amounted to $57 million before tax. In addition, the Company had $9 million of net sales from discontinued initiatives, which are reflected in Employee separation charges in October - December 2002 are associated with severance packages for approximately 1,150 people. The packages are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling, research and administrative positions. The charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs, which totaled $64 million before tax in the quarter ended December 31, 2002, are primarily related to manufacturing operations. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. Charges for asset write-downs relate to the establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. Asset write-downs also include certain manufacturing assets that are expected to operate at levels significantly below their planned capacity. The projected cash flows from such assets over their remaining useful lives were no longer estimated to be greater than their current carrying values; therefore, they are written down to estimated fair value, generally determined by reference to discounted expected future cash flows. Such charges represented $23 million before tax in this quarter. Other costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program amounted to $14 million before tax during October - December 2002. These were primarily for relocation, training, establishment of global business services and results from discontinued initiatives. The Company recently announced its intent to discontinue separate reporting of its current Restructuring Program at the conclusion of the current fiscal year. The Company will continue to undertake projects in future periods to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing consolidation and work force rationalization. The costs of such activities will be reported as part of core",2271

OTHER EVENTS. As disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2002, on May 31, 2002, The Procter & Gamble Company (the ""Company"") completed its spin-off of the Jif and Crisco brands. In addition, effective July 1, 2002, the Company realigned the management of its feminine care business from Baby, Feminine & Family Care to Beauty Care. To reflect these management and business changes, the Company has realigned its internal and external reporting segments. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 (July - September 2002), the feminine care business has been included in the Beauty Care segment, and the former Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment has become Baby & Family Care. The former Food & Beverage segment was renamed Snacks & Beverages, reflecting the remaining businesses. As required by FASB Statement No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, prior year segment results have been reclassified to reflect these changes and provide comparable current and historical results. The elements of the former Food & Beverage segment that were spun off or divested, including Jif, Crisco and commercial shortening and oils, are now presented as part of Corporate. This change affects only the presentation of segment results and does not affect the consolidated results of The Procter & Gamble Company. In this form 8-K filing, segment information for the Company reflecting the new structure is presented for the fiscal years 2000 through 2002.

2003-04-29,10-Q,0000080424-03-000021,"and Analysis Despite continuing softness in the global economy and competitive activity within certain of the Company's core categories, the Company delivered strong sales and earnings growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Businesses in Latin America continue to suffer declines in sales and earnings from the economic and political situation in the region, which had a modest dampening effect on the Company. Going forward, uncertainties in markets such as Latin America and the Middle East could affect results. For a discussion of key factors that could impact and must be managed by the Company, refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis section in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The Company reported net earnings of $1.27 billion or $0.91 diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Results included a $66 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the Company's program to streamline operations and its business portfolio. Net earnings in the year ago quarter were $1.04 billion or $0.74 per share, including a $147 million after-tax Net sales were $10.66 billion, up eight percent versus the year-ago quarter. Unit volume grew seven percent versus the prior year quarter behind double-digit growth in the health care business and nine percent growth in both the fabric and home care and the beauty care businesses. Double-digit volume increases in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe helped drive the volume growth. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased eight percent. Sales growth included a positive foreign exchange impact of three percent, which was partially offset by pricing. Acquisitions and divestitures had a negative two percent impact on sales. The foreign exchange impact represents the benefits of the Euro and British Pound, partially offset by Latin American devaluations. The pricing impacts were directed towards activities to drive top line growth, including expanding the Company's mid-tier and developing market businesses, improving in-store presence and merchandising activities in Western Europe and to achieve competitive pricing on shelf. Examples include the following: the re-launch of a number of beauty and fabric care brands into mid-tier product positionings, pricing adjustments on Crest Whitestrips following competitive entry, price adjustments on baby care to maintain shelf parity versus a key competitor, and promotional investments on coffee and family care to match key competitors' levels of merchandising and remain competitive on shelf. Gross margin was 49.4 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, compared to 48.8 percent in the same quarter of the prior year. This represents an increase of 60 basis points versus a base period that delivered a 320 basis point improvement. The current year increase was driven by a reduction in cost of products sold for charges related to the restructuring program, which totaled $46 million before tax in the current quarter and $107 million in the prior year quarter. Other base business and restructuring savings in the current quarter were reinvested in pricing activities to stimulate growth as discussed in the preceding paragraph, leading to lower margin expansion. Marketing, Research, Administrative, and Other costs (MRA&O), as a percent of sales, decreased from 32.1 percent in the prior year quarter to 31.0 percent in the current year quarter, an improvement of 110 basis points. This improvement was caused by a reduction in restructuring costs, from $99 million in the prior year to $41 million in the current year, a base period that included Clairol transition costs, and lower overhead spending which more than offset increased marketing investments, particularly in fabric and home care, health care and Operating margin increased 170 basis points to 18.4 percent for the quarter, compared to 16.7 percent in the same quarter a year ago. This improvement was caused by lower restructuring charges, which declined from $191 million in the prior year quarter to $87 million in the current quarter, along with the other MRA&O improvements discussed in the preceding paragraph. Fabric and home care unit volume grew nine percent and was broad-based, led by North America home care and Asia and Central and Eastern Europe. Net sales were up eight percent to $3.06 billion. This includes a positive two percent foreign exchange impact partially offset by mix impacts from growth in mid-tier brands and developing markets. Additionally, pricing investments behind mid-tier growth in North America and increased spending to improve in store presence and merchandising activities in Western Europe contributed to sales growth lagging volume growth. Net earnings increased six percent to $499 million, as volume growth was partially offset by the funding of increased initiative spending and in-store marketing investments, including the launch of Mr. Proper in Germany Baby and family care delivered unit volume growth of seven percent behind continued strength in baby care, driven primarily by Pampers Baby Stages of Development, and solid results in North America and Western Europe family care. Net sales increased nine percent to $2.47 billion, including a positive four percent foreign exchange impact. Positive mix behind growth in premium tier diapers was more than offset by temporary pricing adjustments in North America to reach shelf unit price parity with key competition in baby care and retain competitive pricing in family care. Earnings increased 39 percent to $200 million reflecting volume growth, cost reductions and lower promotional marketing investment versus the base period. Beauty care unit volume was up nine percent driven by hair care, including continued strength behind Pantene and Head & Shoulders, and feminine care. Sales grew 10 percent, including a positive four percent foreign exchange impact, reaching $3.03 billion. Negative pricing and mix impacts, driven by the repositioning of the Company's portfolio of hair care brands such as Pert, Aussie and Renewal 5x into multiple price tiers, partially offset foreign exchange impacts. Net earnings were $463 million, up 19 percent driven by volume and continued reductions in cost of products sold, partially offset by increased Health care delivered double-digit unit volume, sales and earnings growth this quarter. Unit volume increased 18 percent driven by strong results in oral care and continued strength in pharmaceuticals. Net sales were $1.43 billion, up 18 percent, including a three percent positive foreign exchange impact that was offset by lower Crest Whitestrips pricing versus year ago. Crest and Actonel led the volume and sales growth. Health care's net earnings increased 19 percent to $147 million primarily behind volume. Progress in health care's gross margin was re-invested in marketing, primarily in oral care. Snacks and beverages unit volume was down one percent as improved snacks results in North America and Western Europe were offset by soft beverage results. Sales grew one percent to $756 million, including a positive four percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings declined 22 percent to $50 million. This partly reflects the response to competitive promotional spending in the U.S. coffee market, which has escalated at a rate in excess of that justified by commodity price declines, resulting in increased promotional spending to defend share. The corporate segment contains both operating and non-operating items that are not included in the business results. Current quarter results primarily reflect lower restructuring costs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2003, cash generated from operating activities totaled $6.74 billion, compared to $5.43 billion in the prior year. Earnings adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes accounted for $5.7 billion of the current year cash flow and $0.9 billion of the $1.31 billion current year improvement. The inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accruals components of working capital changed slightly from June 30, providing $0.4 billion of operating cash flow. Inventories increased as compared to June 30, 2002, while receivables declined. However, both receivables days sales outstanding and inventory days on hand improved versus the year ago period. Accounts payable and other accruals increased as compared to June 30, providing operating cash flows, due to timing differences for payments of other accruals, primarily taxes. Working capital changes during the nine months ended March 31, 2002 provided a higher amount of operating cash flows than the current year due to abnormally low tax payments in the year ago period. Current year activity reflects a return to historical Investing activities used $989 million of cash year to date, compared to $6.61 billion used in the comparable prior year period, which included the Clairol acquisition during the October-December quarter. There has been no significant acquisition activity in the current year. This difference in acquisition activity generated $5.35 billion of the year over year change in investing cash flows. Divestiture proceeds in the current year include the Vicks throat drop business in Japan, certain Clairol small brands and a family care divestiture in China. Prior year divestitures included Comet and PUR Outdoor. Capital spending was also reduced in the current year as compared to the prior year. The Company anticipates that this capital spending rate may increase through the year, but the fiscal year average will be below the Company's revised target of less than five percent of sales. The Company's pending acquisition of Wella AG is discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing activities used $3.66 billion of cash for the current fiscal year versus a source of $1.94 billion in the first nine months of the prior year. The largest driver of this $5.6 billion difference is the prior year issuance of short-term debt to finance the Clairol acquisition. In addition, treasury share purchases used more cash in the current year, reflecting lower repurchase activity in the prior year base period driven by cash needs for the Clairol RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of its operations into product-based global business units, the Company initiated a multi-year restructuring program. The program was designed to accelerate growth and deliver cost reductions by streamlining management decision-making, manufacturing and other work processes and discontinuing under-performing businesses and initiatives. Technology improvements as well as standardization of manufacturing and other work processes allow the Company to streamline operations, resulting in the consolidation of manufacturing activity and various business processes. Costs to be incurred include separation related costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the restructuring During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company recorded charges totaling $87 million before tax ($66 million after tax) related to its restructuring program, as detailed in the following table. In addition, the Company continues to execute similar projects as part of ongoing operations. Restructuring Program July, 2002 - March, 2003 Charges (before tax) Beginning Quarter Current Applied Ending Reserves Charges Quarter Total Cash Against Reserves 6/30/02 Jul-Dec 02 Charges Charges Spent Assets 3/31/03 During January-March 2003, restructuring charges included in the Company's cost of products sold amounted to $46 million before tax and charges included in MRA&O amounted to $41 million before tax. Employee separation charges in January-March 2003 are associated with severance packages for approximately 250 people. The packages are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling, research and administrative positions. The charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs, which totaled $47 million before tax in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, are primarily related to manufacturing operations. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. Charges for asset write-downs relate to the establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. Asset write-downs also include certain manufacturing assets that are expected to operate at levels significantly below their planned capacity. The projected cash flows from such assets over their remaining useful lives were no longer estimated to be greater than their current carrying values; therefore, they are written down to estimated fair value, generally determined by reference to discounted expected future cash flows. Other costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program amounted to $11 million before tax during January-March 2003. These were primarily for relocation, training, establishment of global business services and results from discontinued initiatives. The Company recently announced its intent to discontinue separate reporting of its current Restructuring Program at the conclusion of the current fiscal year. The Company anticipates an increase in the quarterly restructuring charges in April-June 2003, as many enrollment reductions and consolidation projects are completed. The Company, as part of its on-going operations, will continue to undertake similar projects in future periods to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing consolidation and work force rationalization.",2154

Today, the Company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products in many countries throughout the world. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the “Company” as used herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its In March, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Wella AG from the majority shareholders and, in June, 2003, the Company completed a tender offer for the remaining outstanding voting class shares and preference shares. On September 2, 2003, the Company completed the previously announced purchase of the shares of Wella AG held by the majority shareholders for 3.16 billion Euros (approximately based on spot exchange rates on that date). On September 10, 2003, the Company purchased the shares secured through the tender offer for 1.49 billion Euros (approximately $1.67 billion based on spot exchange rates on that date). As a result of these purchases, the Company acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding Wella shares (99% of the voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares). The acquisition was financed by a mixture of available cash balances and debt. Wella AG is a leading beauty care company selling its products in more than 150 countries, focused on professional hair care, retail hair care and cosmetics and fragrances. November 16, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the Clairol business from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and, on May 31, 2002, the Company completed the spin-off of the Jif peanut butter and Crisco shortening brands to the Company’s shareholders and their subsequent merger into the J.M. Smucker In 1999, the Company announced its intention to transition from its previous geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit structure.

2003-10-28,10-Q,0000080424-03-000167,"and Analysis For the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company had double-digit volume, sales and earnings growth despite strong base period comparisons and heavy competitive activity in certain of the Company's core categories. Going forward, business and market uncertainties could affect results. For a discussion of key factors that could impact and must be managed by the Company, please refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis section in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. Unit volume increased 12 percent, with all business segments and all geographic regions reporting unit volume growth. Double-digit increases in Health Care, Beauty Care and developing regions helped drive the volume growth. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the recently completed acquisition of Wella AG, unit volume increased nine percent. Net sales increased 13 percent to $12.20 billion. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of three percent, partially offset by mix of one percent and pricing investments of one percent. The foreign exchange impact reflects the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound partially offset by weakening of the Venezuelan Bolivar and the Mexican Peso. Mix was driven, in part, by higher than expected growth in developing markets, including strong growth in China, and the continued portfolio expansion into mid-tier brands. Pricing investments were directed toward activities to drive top line growth in multiple businesses and to respond to competitive activity on Crest Whitestrips and continued high competitive promotion levels in the bath tissue and kitchen The Company reported net earnings of $1.76 billion, an increase of 20 percent versus the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was primarily driven by volume impacts, the completion of the prior year restructuring program, which had $113 million of after-tax charges in the base period, and lower manufacturing costs, despite inclusion of ongoing costs for restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure. These improvements were partially offset by marketing investments to support base business and new product growth. Net earnings per share were $1.26, an increase of 21 percent. Net earnings in the prior year quarter were $1.46 billion or $1.04 per share. Wella did not have a significant impact on net earnings. Gross margin was 51.8 percent for the quarter compared to 49.2 percent for the same quarter of the prior year, an increase of 260 basis points. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by lower cost of products sold due to the scale effect of volume, the reduction of before-tax charges related to the completed restructuring program of $88 million in the prior year quarter and material cost savings, which more than offset certain commodity price increases. Other base business and restructuring savings in the quarter more than offset the pricing investments discussed previously. Marketing, Research, Administration and Other Costs (MRA&O) for the quarter increased to 30.1 percent versus 29.0 percent in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by marketing spending and the impact of the Wella acquisition, which more than offset the reduction in prior year restructuring program charges. Marketing investments were made to drive growth on the base business and in support of initiatives such as Crest Whitestrips and Night Effects, Olay Regenerist, Swiffer and Prilosec OTC. The addition of Wella contributed approximately one third of the basis point increase due to higher MRA&O spending as a percent of sales and initial post-acquisition costs. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 21.7 percent for the quarter, compared to 20.2 percent in the same quarter year ago. The improvement was driven by the reduction in prior year restructuring program charges and lower cost of products sold, partially offset by the impact of higher MRA&O spending discussed in the previous paragraph. The Company entered into several multi-year service contracts for services estimated at $3.6 billion. The biggest of these went into effect during the quarter ended September 30, 2003, while the remainder will go into effect in The following provides supplemental information on the underlying drivers of net JULY-SEPTEMBER NET SALES INFORMATION (Percent Change vs. Year Ago) ** Acquisitions/ Acquisitions/ Total Total Impact Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Mix/Other Impact Ex-FX ** These sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Fabric & Home Care volume was up eight percent behind strong growth in global fabric care led by the developing regions and double-digit growth in global home care, with the continued success of the Swiffer WetJet and Duster, Dawn Power Dissolver and Dawn Complete and Febreze Anti-Allergen initiatives. Net sales increased eight percent to $3.39 billion. A three percent positive foreign exchange impact was offset by pricing and mix effects. Pricing reflects the continuation of pricing investments taken on select fabric care segments in North America, markets in Western Europe and on the Swiffer brand. Mix reduced sales by two percent driven by double-digit growth in developing geographies, including the expansion of Tide in China, and the expansion of mid-tier brands, including the growth of Bold in Japan. Net earnings increased to $562 million, or three percent versus a strong base period of 22 percent growth. Earnings were impacted by mix effects and increased marketing spending to support product initiatives. Fabric & Home Care earnings growth is expected to improve over the remainder of the fiscal year. Beauty Care volume increased 21 percent, including the benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Wella. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, Beauty Care volume increased eight percent despite heavy competitive activity in North America. Net sales increased 20 percent to $3.75 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of three percent. Negative mix of three percent was driven by the impact of Wella and developing market growth. The solid base business results were driven by continued global strength of the Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Always/Whisper and Olay brands. Net earnings for Beauty Care increased 12 percent to $616 million driven by volume growth and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by increased marketing spending to defend against competitive entries in the hair care and skin care categories. Marketing spending also increased to support initiatives, including Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal in Japan, the expansion of Olay Regenerist and continued support of Baby and Family Care unit volume increased six percent. Baby care volume growth was primarily driven by continued momentum in the Baby Stages of Development line in Western Europe and North America, growth in Japan and the broadening of the diaper product line in Latin America. Net sales grew seven percent to $2.61 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of three percent, partially offset by pricing investments of one percent and mix of one percent. Pricing was driven by continued high competitive promotional activity in North America family care. Earnings increased 22 percent to $295 million, due to strong volume growth and lower costs including the scale effects of volume. Health Care delivered volume growth of 23 percent driven by the Prilosec OTC launch in September, the continued success of Actonel, Crest Whitestrips and Night Effects tooth whitening products and base business strength. Net sales increased 23 percent to $1.73 billion, as a positive three percent foreign exchange impact was offset by mix and pricing, primarily the actions on Crest Whitestrips taken in November 2002. Although Prilosec OTC was an important contributor to the quarter results, even without the launch, Health Care delivered double-digit volume, sales and earnings growth. Net earnings increased 41 percent to $276 million as strong volume, sales and lower product costs funded marketing investments behind base business growth and new product introductions. While double-digit top line growth is expected for the fiscal year, results in the remaining quarters are expected to return to consumption levels following the one-time pipeline impact from Prilosec OTC. Additionally, although Prilosec OTC volume was particularly strong with the launch, associated marketing expenses will continue throughout the year. Snacks & Beverages volume was up three percent reflecting growth in the Pringles and Folgers brands, partially offset by volume declines in the juice category. Net sales were $896 million, an increase of nine percent, reflecting the benefits of a three percent impact from foreign exchange and three percent from price and mix impacts. Positive pricing includes a partial pass-through of higher commodity costs. For the balance of the fiscal year, the Company expects pricing will have a neutral or slightly negative impact on sales based on the aggressive pricing environment of the coffee category. Net earnings increased 20 percent to $109 million behind volume and sales growth and margin expansion due to base business savings. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting principles to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). Current quarter results primarily reflect lower restructuring program charges partially offset by one-time items in the prior year quarter, including the impact of the Vicks For the three months ended September 30, 2003, cash generated from operating activities totaled $1.61 billion compared to $2.01 billion in the comparable prior year period. The decrease in cash from operations is due to increases in working capital, as well as base period impacts due to dividends received from a joint venture. Accounts receivable grew slightly ahead of sales since June 30, 2003. The year-over-year accounts receivable increase of $0.3 billion is attributed to sales growth, particularly the timing of the Prilosec OTC launch in September, offset to some extent by an underlying improvement in days sales outstanding. These trends follow a two-day improvement in receivables days outstanding in the prior year period. Inventory increased primarily due to initiative-related activity, shipment trends and capacity utilization planning. The slight increase in inventory days on hand (approximately two days, excluding inventory acquired from Wella) compares to a seven day decrease in the prior Investing activities used $5.30 billion of cash year-to-date compared to $0.20 billion used in the prior year period. The acquisition of Wella is the key driver accounting for approximately $5.10 billion. The Company's acquisition of Wella is discussed in Note 4 of the financial statements. There was no acquisition activity in the comparable prior year period. Capital spending increased to $364 million in the current year versus $281 million in the comparable prior year period. Capital spending as a percent of net sales was three percent, one percentage point below target. Financing activities provided $1.96 billion in cash for the current fiscal year versus using $0.52 billion in the comparable prior year period. This generated a net cash increase of $2.48 billion driven primarily by short-term debt to support the Wella acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM UPDATE In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of its operations into product-based global business units, the Company initiated a multi-year restructuring program. This program was substantially complete at the end of 2003. At June 30, 2003, there was a reserve liability balance remaining of $335 million for the program. This liability is expected to be settled by the end of 2004 through cash payments primarily for separations. The Company continues to undertake projects to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing consolidations and work force rationalization, as part of its normal operations.",1856

During the first six months of the fiscal year through December 31, 2003, the Company delivered strong top line results and double-digit earnings growth, despite widespread competitive activity. All business segments posted volume and earnings growth. Results include the impact of the Wella acquisition which was completed in September 2003. Sales grew ahead of volume due to positive foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by mix (driven by high growth in developing markets) and pricing activity. Earnings increased due to the scale benefit of volume, the completion of the Company's restructuring program which had $211 million of after tax charges in the base period, and lower manufacturing costs. Earnings growth was partially offset by continued marketing investments in the base business and in support of product initiatives. Going forward, business and market uncertainties may affect results.

Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, Beauty Care volume increased 10 percent. Health Care and Fabric and Home Care volume increased 17 and nine percent, respectively. Developing markets delivered strong, double-digit unit Net sales increased 20 percent to $13.22 billion. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of four percent due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian dollar, British pound and Japanese yen, offset by weakening of the Mexican Peso and Venezuelan Bolivar. Mix was driven primarily by continued high growth in developing markets, including China and Latin America. Pricing activity, largely in response to competition, reduced sales by one percent. Pricing includes responses to competitive actions across multiple categories including family care in North America and Fabric and Home Care in Europe and the Middle East. The table below identifies the drivers to net sales changes versus the prior year quarter by business segment: Acquisitions/ Acquisitions/ Total Impact Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Mix/Other Impact Ex-FX Note: These sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Net earnings increased 22 percent to $1.82 billion. Earnings growth was primarily driven by volume benefits, the completion of the prior year restructuring program (which included $98 million after tax in the base period) and lower manufacturing costs. These improvements were partially offset by marketing investments to support base business growth and new initiatives. Net earnings per share were $1.30, an increase of 23 percent, including a slightly accretive effect from Wella. Gross margin expanded 210 basis points. Of this, 70 basis points ($75 million before tax) relates to restructuring charges in the prior period. Of the remaining 140 basis points of expansion, approximately half was driven by the addition of Wella, which has a higher gross margin than the base business. The remaining half was driven by the scale benefit of volume growth, the mix impact of higher volume in the Health and Beauty Care businesses, and product cost Marketing, Research, Administrative and Other Costs (MRA&O) as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points. The large majority of this basis point increase is due to Wella, reflecting a higher ratio of marketing expenses to sales than the base business and initial post-acquisition costs. The remaining increase in spending reflects investments behind the base business and support for initiatives. The addition of Wella and increased marketing investments more than offset the basis point improvement due to the non-recurrence of restructuring program charges ($57 million before tax) in the base period.

Volume growth was led by Beauty Care, up 33 percent, and Health Care, up 20 percent. Developing markets delivered double-digit volume growth with strong results in China and Central and Eastern Europe. For the first six months of the fiscal year, net sales increased 17 percent to $25.42 billion. Foreign exchange contributed three percent to sales growth. Pricing and mix combined for a negative two percent impact on sales growth. Pricing investments include activities to drive top line growth in multiple businesses and to respond to competition.

The table below identifies the drivers to net sales changes fiscal year to date versus the prior year by business segment: Acquisitions/ Acquisitions/ Total Impact Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Mix/Other Impact Ex-FX Note: These sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Fiscal year to date earnings increased 21 percent to $3.58 billion. Earnings growth was driven by volume benefits, the completion of the restructuring program (which included $211 million of after tax charges in the prior year period) and product cost savings. Earnings growth was partially offset by continued marketing investments in the base business and in support of initiatives. Net earnings per share increased 22 percent to $2.56 compared to $2.10 in the base period. Gross margin fiscal year to date was 52.0 percent compared to 49.6 percent in the prior year, an increase of 240 basis points. The gross margin improvement was driven by the scale benefit of volume, the reduction of before tax charges related to the completed restructuring program of $163 million, the addition of Wella which has a higher gross margin than the base business, the mix shift to the Health and Beauty Care segments (which have higher gross margins than the Company average) and base business product cost savings. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of pricing and higher commodity Marketing, Research, Administrative and Other Costs (MRA&O) fiscal year to date increased to 30.8 percent from 29.3 percent of net sales in the comparable base period, an increase of 150 basis points. The majority of the increase is due to Wella, reflecting a higher ratio of marketing expenses to sales than the base business and initial post-acquisition costs. Marketing investments were made to drive growth on the base business and in support of initiatives. The spending increases associated with Wella and marketing investments more than offset the reduction in prior year restructuring program charges of $120 million before BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION The following tables provide supplemental information on net earnings and the underlying drivers of net sales changes by business segment for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 and fiscal year to date: THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended December 31, 2003 % Change Earnings % Change % Change Versus Before Versus Net Versus Net Sales Year Ago Income Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago Six Months Ended December 31, 2003 % Change Earnings % Change % Change Versus Before Versus Net Versus Net Sales Year Ago Income Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago For the quarter, volume was up nine percent behind Tide, Gain, Era and the continued success of initiatives including Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and Swiffer Duster. Net sales increased 10 percent to $3.41 billion. Sales growth includes a positive four percent foreign exchange impact that was partially offset by negative pricing and mix. Mix was driven by continued strong growth in developing markets, particularly China and Central and Eastern Europe. Pricing had a one percent impact on sales and represents primarily the continuation of prior period actions to maintain competitiveness. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $570 million driven primarily by volume, as lower manufacturing costs were offset by the profit impact of continued pricing actions. For the first six months of the fiscal year, Fabric and Home Care volume increased nine percent. Net sales increased nine percent, including a positive foreign exchange impact of three percent. Mix and pricing impacts combined for a negative three percent impact on sales. Net earnings increased seven percent. Earnings growth lags sales growth for the first six months of the fiscal year due to a high base period comparison in the July - September quarter. Total volume in the October - December quarter increased 45 percent including acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Wella. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, Beauty Care volume increased 10 percent. Strong base business results were led by double-digit growth by the Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Herbal Essences hair care brands, Olay skin care and the Always feminine care brand. Net sales increased 50 percent to $4.49 billion, including a positive five percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings were $681 million, an increase of 34 percent, due to strong top line growth, including Wella. Gross margin expansion was partially offset by the higher ratio of marketing expenses to sales for the Wella business, increased marketing investments in the North America hair care and skin care businesses and in support of initiatives (including Boss Intense, Lacoste Pour Femme, Rejoice in Greater China, Always/Alldays upgrades, Herbal Essences and Pantene in Western Europe and the geographic expansion of Olay Regenerist and Total Effects). The Wella acquisition was accretive to Beauty Care earnings. Interest and amortization expenses associated with Wella are included in Corporate. For the six months ended December 31, Beauty Care volume increased 33 percent. Volume growth fiscal year to date reflects the Wella acquisition, completed in September, and double-digit increases in developing markets. Net sales increased 35 percent to $8.25 billion. A positive foreign exchange impact of four percent was partially offset by pricing and mix. Net earnings increased 23 percent to $1.30 billion. Volume benefits and lower product costs were partially offset by additional marketing investments to support the base business and initiatives. For the quarter ended December 31, volume increased four percent behind strong growth in baby care - primarily in Western Europe and developing markets. Family care volume was flat due, in part, to high promotional spending levels by key competitors. Net sales increased six percent to $2.67 billion. Foreign exchange was a positive impact of five percent; the impact of volume on sales was partially offset by pricing and mix. Mix was primarily driven by strong growth in mid-tier diaper products in developing markets. Pricing had a negative one percent effect on sales in response to increased competitive promotional activity in North America family care. Earnings grew two percent against strong base period results (21 percent increase) to $281 million. Earnings in baby care increased due to volume and cost savings, largely offset by the aforementioned pricing investments and rising commodity costs in family care. Fiscal year to date, Baby and Family Care volume increased five percent. Baby care volume increased high single-digits, while family care volume increased low single-digits. Net sales increased seven percent to $5.28 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of four percent. Price and mix combined for a negative two percent impact. Earnings were $576 million, an increase of 11 percent, as profit growth behind volume and product cost savings was partially offset by pricing investments and increased commodity costs. Health Care unit volume increased 17 percent during the October - December quarter driven by the continued success of Actonel, Prilosec OTC and oral care. Vicks also posted strong unit volume growth due to the early cough/cold season in North America. Net sales increased 22 percent to $1.91 billion aided by a positive four percent foreign exchange impact and one percent for pricing. Net earnings were $333 million, an increase of 32 percent, on strong volume, lower manufacturing costs and margin expansion due to product mix. Marketing spending increased versus the base period primarily behind continued support of Prilosec OTC, Crest Whitestrips and Crest Night Effects. While double-digit top line growth is expected for the fiscal year, Prilosec OTC volume in the remaining quarters is expected to reflect consumption levels following the successful launch in September and continued strong results in October - December quarter. Fiscal year to date, Health Care volume increased 20 percent. Net sales were $3.64 billion, an increase of 22 percent. Sales growth was impacted by a positive three percent for foreign exchange. Mix was a negative one percent impact driven primarily by developing market growth. Net earnings increased 36 percent to $609 million. Earnings increased behind sales growth and margin expansion, including the impact of product cost savings. Snacks and Beverages unit volume increased one percent. Beverages volume increased two percent driven primarily by the Folgers AromaSeal initiative. Net sales increased six percent to $931 million driven primarily by a foreign exchange benefit of four percent. Volume and mix gains were partially offset by increased merchandising costs to support the continued high level of promotional activity in the coffee category. Manufacturing costs increased behind initiative start-up expenses. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $122 million behind sales growth and lower marketing and administrative spending. For the first six months of the fiscal year, Snacks and Beverages volume increased two percent. Net sales increased seven percent to $1.83 billion, reflecting volume growth, a positive foreign exchange impact of four percent and combined mix and pricing of one percent. Net earnings in Snacks and Beverages increased 15 percent to $231 million. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting principles to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). For the quarter, net sales were -$190 million compared to -$68 million in the prior period, primarily driven by eliminations due to stronger joint venture sales. Net earnings for the quarter were -$169 million compared to -$166 million in the comparable prior period. Results primarily reflect lower costs from the restructuring program offset by charges associated with Wella and hedging impacts. For the first six months of the fiscal year, Corporate net sales were -$372 million compared to - -$185 million in the prior period. Net earnings for the six month period were - -$266 million versus -$325 million in the same period year ago. Cash generated from operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2003 was $3.96 billion compared to $4.33 billion in the comparable prior period. Strong earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes) generated $4.67 billion of cash flow and were partially offset by increases in working capital. Working capital increased by $0.9 billion during the period. Accounts receivable increased by $0.5 billion due mainly to strong December shipments. Accounts payable decreased reflecting the Company's continued effort to accelerate payments to suppliers in order to maximize efficiencies and capture all Cash generated from operating activities is down $0.4 billion versus the comparable prior year period. The impact of increased earnings in the current period were offset by a larger increase in working capital and the impact of dividends received from a joint venture in the base period. Investing activities in the current year decreased cash by $6.11 billion compared to a decrease of $0.5 billion in prior year period. The primary driver was the acquisition of Wella for approximately $5.10 billion. Additional current year acquisitions include Glide Dental Floss and fabric care brands in Western Europe and the Middle East. There was no acquisition activity in the comparable Capital spending increased to $810 million versus $616 million in the comparable prior period. Capital spending as a percent of sales increased slightly versus the comparable period, but was still below the Company's target of four percent. Financing activities in the current fiscal year to date increased cash by $1.14 billion, representing a year-over-year cash increase of $3.29 billion. Cash from financing includes an increase in short and long-term debt to support the Wella acquisition. The Company issued $1.38 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with varying maturity dates. Additionally, two bonds matured reducing long-term debt $993 million. The net change in long-term debt is an increase of $412 million versus June 30. Treasury share repurchases were roughly in line with the comparable base period. Treasury share repurchases through the remainder of the fiscal year are expected to be higher than the prior year. The Company purchased approximately $200 million of stock in the January - June 2003 Current assets net of current liabilities declined by approximately $3.3 billion during the six months ended December 31, 2003. This decline was primarily caused by the issuance of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of Wella AG. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long and short-term credit ratings which will enable it to refinance this debt at favorable rates in the commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions that, should they be needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.",3046

2004-04-30,10-Q,0000080424-04-000075,"and Analysis of Financial Condition and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Results of Operations - Three Months Ended March 31, 2004 Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended March 31, 2004 Business Segment Discussion (for the three and nine months ended The Company markets approximately 300 consumer products in more than 160 countries around the world in five distinct business segments: Fabric and Home Care, Beauty Care, Baby and Family Care, Health Care and Snacks and Beverages. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by business segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): NET SALES NET EARNINGS The Company has expressed its intent to focus on strategies that are right for the long term health of the business as measured by shareholder return. Long term targets include: sales growth of 4% to 6% excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from year-over-year comparisons, double-digit earnings per share growth, and greater than 90 percent free cash flow productivity (defined as the ratio of net earnings divided by the difference of operating cash flow less capital expenditures). MD&A will reference results for the quarter and fiscal year to date against these targets. For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, the Company delivered sales and earnings growth above long-term targets. Net sales increased 18 percent (14% excluding foreign exchange impacts) while net earnings increased 21 percent, with all business segments posting sales and earnings growth. Results of the Beauty Care segment include the impact of the Wella acquisition which was completed in September 2003. Sales grew ahead of volume due to positive foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by mix (driven by high growth in developing markets) and pricing activity. Earnings increased due to the scale benefit of volume, the completion of the Company's restructuring program which had $277 million of after tax charges in the base period, and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by increased marketing investments in the base business and in support of product initiatives. The markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and comprised of both global and local competitors. Going forward, business and market uncertainties may affect results. Among the key factors that could impact results and must be managed by the Company are: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including growing existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in which the Company has chosen to focus; (2) successfully executing, managing and integrating key acquisitions (including the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement with Wella) and completing planned divestitures (including the divestiture of the Company's juice business); (3) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (4) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability matters), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (6) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including the success of the Company's outsourcing projects; (7) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries), interest rate and certain commodity cost (8) the ability to manage the continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in the Company's significant geographical markets, as well as any political and/or economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities; and (9) the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the Company's products. If the Company's assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Company's actual results could vary materially from the forward-looking RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2004 versus the three months ended March 31, 2003. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended March 31 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET 67 37 AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 1,395.0 1,395.8 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES Unit volume for the quarter increased 20 percent, with all business segments and geographic regions reporting unit volume growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Wella, unit volume increased 12 percent. Volume growth was led by Beauty Care, up 41 percent, and Health Care, up 19 percent. Developing markets delivered double-digit volume growth led by China and Central and Eastern Europe. Net sales increased 22 percent to $13.03 billion. Net sales increased behind volume growth, the addition of Wella and a positive foreign exchange impact of five percent due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar. Product mix reduced sales growth by two percent reflecting higher growth in developing markets, including China and Latin America. Developing markets generally have an average unit sales price lower than the Company average. Pricing activity reduced sales growth by one percent largely in response to competition in multiple categories including coffee and family care in the United States and Beauty Care and Fabric and Home Care in North America and Europe. The table below identifies the drivers to net sales changes versus the prior year quarter by business segment: Acquisitions/ Acquisitions/ Total Impact Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Mix/Other Impact Ex-FX Note: These sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Net earnings increased 20 percent to $1.53 billion. Earnings growth was primarily driven by volume benefits and the completion of the prior year restructuring program (which included $66 million after tax in the base period). These improvements were partially offset by marketing investments to support base business growth and new initiatives, as well as current period charges to maintain a competitive cost structure. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.09, an increase of 20 percent. The acquisition of Wella had a slightly dilutive effect on total Company earnings. Gross margin expanded 150 basis points, with 40 basis points of the improvement ($46MM before tax) related to restructuring program charges in the prior year. The remaining 110 basis points of gross margin expansion were predominately driven by the scale benefit of volume. Base business savings and the addition of Wella, which has a higher gross margin than the consolidated Company average, also contributed to margin expansion. These items were partially offset by the impact of pricing, higher commodity costs, increased mix of developing markets (which have lower average margins) and current year charges for actions associated with organizational streamlining and other projects to maintain a competitive cost structure. Marketing, Research, Administrative and Other Costs (MRA&O) as a percentage of net sales increased 220 basis points. The prior year period includes $41 million before tax of restructuring program charges. The majority of the basis point increase was due to the Wella acquisition reflecting a higher ratio of MRA&O expenses to sales than the base business. The remaining increase reflects marketing investments to sustain growth behind the base business and initiatives, partially offset by the non-recurrence of prior year restructuring costs, which represented a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2003. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Nine Months Ended March 31 MARKETING, RESEARCH, ADMINISTRATIVE & OTHER 12,160 9,700 25 % OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET 136 214 AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 1,398.1 1,401.9 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES MARKETING, RESEARCH, ADMINISTRATIVE & OTHER 31.6 % 29.9 % 170 Fiscal year to date, unit volume increased 17 percent with all business segments and geographic regions delivering unit volume growth. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, unit volume increased 10 percent through the first nine months of the fiscal year. Volume growth was led by Beauty Care, up 35 percent, and Health Care, up 20 percent. Developing markets delivered double-digit volume growth led by China and Central and Eastern Europe. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, net sales increased 18 percent to $38.45 billion. Foreign exchange contributed four percent to sales growth behind the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. Product mix reduced sales growth by two percent reflecting higher growth in developing markets, including China and Latin America. Developing markets generally have an average unit sales price lower than the Company average. Pricing investments include activities to drive top line growth in multiple businesses and to respond to competitors' actions. The table below identifies the drivers to changes in net sales fiscal year to date versus the prior year by business Acquisitions/ Acquisitions/ Total Total Impact Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Mix/Other Impact Ex-FX Note: These sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Fiscal year to date earnings increased 21 percent to $5.11 billion. Earnings growth was driven by volume benefits, the completion of the restructuring program (which included $277 million of after tax charges in the prior year period) and product cost savings. Earnings growth was partially offset by increased marketing investments in the base business and in support of initiatives. Diluted net earnings per share increased 21 percent to $3.65 compared to $3.01 in the base period. Gross margin expanded 200 basis points, with 60 basis points of the improvement related to restructuring program charges in the base period of $209 million. The remaining gross margin improvement was driven by the scale benefit of volume, base business savings and the addition of Wella which has a higher gross margin than the base business. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of higher commodity costs and the pricing actions mentioned above, as well as current year restructuring activity. Marketing, Research, Administrative and Other Costs (MRA&O) as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points. The prior year period includes $161 million of restructuring program charges. The majority of the increase is due to Wella, reflecting a higher ratio of marketing expenses to sales than the base business. The balance was due to marketing investments made to drive growth on the base business and in support of initiatives, partially offset by the non-recurrence of prior year restructuring charges which resulted in a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. An analysis of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004 are compared to the same periods ended March 31, 2003. The table below provides supplemental information on net earnings by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004 versus the comparable THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 % Change Earnings % Change % Change Versus Before Versus Net Versus Net Sales Year Ago Income Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 % Change Earnings % Change % Change Versus Before Versus Net Versus Net Sales Year Ago Income Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago For the quarter, Fabric and Home Care unit volume was up 12 percent behind growth on established brands such as Tide, Ariel and Gain and the continued success of initiatives including Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, Mr. Clean AutoDry, Swiffer Duster, Gain Fabric Enhancer, and the expansion of Lenor in Japan. Net sales increased 17 percent to $3.58 billion. Sales growth includes a positive five percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing of negative one percent was primarily driven by the continuation of prior period actions to maintain competitive shelf pricing. Positive mix of one percent was due to the higher growth in the home care business which has a higher sales per unit rate than the segment average, which was partially offset by developing market growth. Net earnings increased 10 percent to $548 million. Earnings margin was impacted by the mix effect of strong developing market growth which has a lower gross margin than the segment average, marketing investments and startup costs to support initiative activity, and startup costs for manufacturing optimization. For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, Fabric and Home Care volume increased 10 percent. Volume was driven by growth in the fabric care business, particularly in developing regions, and growth in the home care business behind initiatives. Net sales increased 12 percent to $10.38 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of four percent. Mix reduced sales by one percent driven primarily by double-digit growth in developing markets. Net earnings were $1.68 billion, an increase of eight percent, due to volume growth and base business cost savings, partially offset by the mix effect of strong developing market growth which has a lower gross margin than the segment average, the aforementioned pricing actions and higher costs, including marketing support for initiatives. Beauty Care unit volume in the January - March quarter increased 41 percent. Excluding the impact of Wella, unit volume increased 13 percent. Global hair care volume grew in all regions with particular progress in the Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Herbal Essences brands. In feminine care, volume growth was driven by Always/Alldays and Naturella in Latin America. Olay delivered double-digit growth. Net sales increased 48 percent to $4.47 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of six percent. Positive mix contributed two percent to sales growth due to higher growth rates in premium priced products with a higher sales per unit rate than the segment average, including Wella, Olay Regenerist and fine fragrances. Net earnings increased 28 percent to $593 million. While the higher marketing and administrative expense ratio for Wella impacts margins, earnings growth reflects volume and continued marketing investments to support the base businesses and initiatives. Key initiatives include the geographic expansion of Herbal Essences and Head & Shoulders, as well as support for Lacoste Red and Olay Regenerist. The Wella acquisition was accretive to Beauty Care earnings in the quarter, but slightly dilutive to the Company as the interest and amortization expenses related to Wella are included For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, Beauty Care volume increased 35 percent versus the comparable prior year period. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures from year-over-year comparisons, Beauty Care volume increased 10 percent. Volume growth was broad-based behind hair care, feminine care, personal beauty and in developing markets. Net sales increased 39% to $12.71 billion. Sales growth includes a positive foreign exchange impact of five percent, partially offset by negative pricing of one percent. Pricing includes actions to support the North American hair, colorants and cosmetics and Western European feminine care businesses. Net earnings increased 25 percent to $1.89 billion. Volume benefits and lower product costs were partially offset by marketing investments to support product initiatives and the base business. Earnings margin was also negatively impacted by the higher expense ratios of Wella. Fiscal year to date, the Wella acquisition was accretive to Beauty Care earnings and a slight gain on Company earnings after including the impacts of interest and amortization expense. Baby and Family Care volume increased seven percent for the quarter ended March 31. Volume was driven by double-digit growth in Pampers diaper, particularly in Western Europe and developing markets, and Bounty paper towel brands. Net sales increased nine percent to $2.71 billion, including a positive foreign exchange impact of five percent. Sales were reduced by two percent from mix driven primarily by growth of diapers in developing markets and baby wipes, which have a lower average revenue per unit than the segment average. Promotional activity, primarily in North America family care to match higher levels of competitive spending, resulted in a one percent pricing impact. Net earnings grew 10 percent to $219 million. Earnings improved behind volume strength and cost savings, partly offset by the aforementioned pricing investments and higher commodity For the nine months ended March 31, Baby and Family Care volume increased six percent driven primarily by double-digit growth in baby care, including gains in Western Europe and developing markets, and low single-digit growth in family care. Family care volume growth fiscal year to date reflects a difficult competitive environment, particularly in North America, as competitors increased promotional spending. Net sales increased eight percent to $7.99 billion versus the comparable prior year period, including a positive foreign exchange impact of five percent. Sales were negatively impacted by pricing of two percent primarily due to increased competitive promotional activity in North America family care. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $795 million as profit growth from volume and product cost savings was partially offset by pricing and increases in commodity costs. The Company recently announced North America family care will increase prices six percent effective in July to partially recover increases in commodity costs. For the quarter, Health Care unit volume increased 19 percent driven by pharmaceuticals, Prilosec OTC, oral care and developing markets. Net sales increased 20 percent to $1.72 billion including a positive four percent foreign exchange impact. Developing market growth in oral care and pipeline shipments for generic Macrobid, which have a lower average revenue per unit than the segment average, resulted in a negative three percent mix impact on sales. Net earnings were $215 million, an increase of 46 percent. Operating margin expansion due to volume, product mix (including the increase in pharmaceutical sales), manufacturing cost savings and lower overhead spending as a percentage of sales were the key drivers behind earnings growth versus the base period. Margin expansion was partially offset by marketing spending versus the comparable prior year period in support of Prilosec OTC and Crest whitening Through the first nine months of the fiscal year ended March 31, Health Care volume increased 20 percent behind initiatives. Sales increased 22 percent to $5.36 billion, and included a positive four percent impact from foreign exchange. Mix had a negative two percent impact on sales due to strong growth in developing markets and the aforementioned pipeline impact of generic Macrobid. Net earnings increased 38 percent to $824 million. Earnings growth was primarily driven by sales growth behind initiatives and margin expansion due to product mix, manufacturing cost savings and lower overhead spending as a percentage of sales. Margin expansion was negatively impacted by increased Snacks and Beverages unit volume increased two percent, with progress on Pringles and Folgers. Net sales increased six percent to $800 million, including a positive foreign exchange impact of five percent. Pricing, primarily coffee promotional spending, negatively impacted sales by three percent. Positive mix of two percent was due to growth in Folgers which has a higher average sales per unit rate than the segment. Net earnings were $55 million, an For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Snacks and Beverages volume increased two percent driven by mid-single digit volume growth on the Pringles and Folgers brands. Net sales were $2.63 billion, representing an increase of seven percent versus the comparable prior period. Sales growth includes a positive four percent impact from foreign exchange. Price and mix combined for a one percent positive impact to sales growth. Net earnings increased 14 percent to $286 million as volume and base business savings were partially offset by higher commodity costs. In April, the Company announced an agreement to sell the juice business. The transaction is expected to be completed during the July - Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting principles to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). For the quarter, net sales were -$243 million compared to -$88 million in the prior period. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, net sales held in Corporate were -$615 million compared to -$273 million in the base period. For both the quarter and fiscal year to date, the change in net sales in Corporate was primarily driven by eliminations due to stronger joint venture sales. Net earnings for the quarter were -$102 million compared to -$86 million in the prior year. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, net earnings were - -$368 million compared to -$411 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter and fiscal year to date reflect lower charges versus the base period due to the completion of the restructuring program offset by higher interest and intangible asset amortization charges associated with Wella, hedging impacts and current year charges for activities to maintain a competitive cost structure. Cash generated from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 was $6.94 billion compared to $6.74 billion in the prior year period. Strong earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes) generated $6.74 billion of cash. Cash generated from operating activities is up $200 million versus the prior year period as the impact of increased earnings was partially offset by an increase in working capital, the impact of dividends received from a joint venture in the base period and the impact of the timing of certain tax payments related to the prior year. Working capital increased by $154 million year-over-year due to the impact of business growth partially offset by strong working capital performance as a result of the Company's focus on cash management. Both accounts receivable days' outstanding and inventory days improved excluding the impact of Wella. Investing activities in the current year used $6.67 billion compared to $989 million in the prior year period. The primary driver was the acquisition of Wella for approximately $5.10 billion, as well as certain smaller acquisitions such as Glide Dental Floss and fabric care brands in Western Europe and the Capital spending was $1.33 billion versus $967 million in the prior year period. Capital spending as a percent of sales increased versus the prior year but was still below the Company's target of four percent. On April 26, 2004, the Company announced it had concluded a domination and profit transfer agreement with Wella AG's Supervisory Board. The agreement is subject to approval by Wella's shareholders at their annual general meeting in June. As required by German law, the Company will make a cash offer of EUR 72.86 per share to Wella AG minority shareholders for all outstanding ordinary and preference shares. As an alternative to the cash offer, minority shareholders in Wella AG have the option to receive a fixed annual payment of EUR 3.81 per ordinary share and EUR 3.83 per preference share. Assuming all remaining minority shareholders tender their shares under the offer, the total consideration paid will be approximately EUR 1.1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion based on current exchange rates). Financing activities used net cash of $828 million for the period compared to $3.66 billion in the prior year period. Financing activities in the current year include an increase in the Company's debt position primarily to support the acquisition of Wella AG. Short term debt increased by $2.07 billion and the Company has issued $1.96 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with varying maturity dates. Additionally, long term debt reduced by $1.10 billion primarily due to the maturing of two bonds. The net change in long term debt is an increase of $859 million versus June 30, Treasury share purchases were $2.33 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2004, an increase of $1.09 billion versus the prior year period. Treasury share purchases for the remainder of the fiscal are expected to continue at an accelerated rate versus the prior year. Actual purchases will depend on available cash balances, consistent with the Company's cash utilization Current assets net of current liabilities declined by approximately $2.7 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2004. This decline was primarily caused by the issuance of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of Wella AG. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long and short-term ratings which will enable it to refinance this debt at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions that, if needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing",4065

Pro Forma Stock-Based Compensation - The Company has a primary stock-based compensation plan under which stock options are granted annually to key managers and directors with exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Grants were made under plans approved by shareholders in 1992, 2001 and 2003. Grants issued since September 2002 are vested after three years and have a ten-year life. Grants issued from July 1998 through August 2002 are vested after three years and have a fifteen-year life, while grants issued prior to July 1998 are vested after one year and have a ten-year life. The Company also makes other minor grants to employees, for which vesting terms and option lives are not substantially different. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" the Company has elected to account for its employee stock option plans under APB Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"" which recognizes expense based on the intrinsic value at date of grant. As stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date, no compensation cost has resulted. Had compensation cost for all options granted been determined based on the fair value at grant date consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and earnings per share would Net earnings per common share The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and 6.

Total comprehensive income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $3,001 million and $2,429 million, respectively.

Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Earnings Before Earnings Before Net Sales Income Taxes Net Earnings Net Sales Income Taxes Net Earnings 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill as of December 31, 2004 is allocated by reportable segment as follows (amounts in millions): Total Beauty Care, beginning of year $ 14,457 Acquistions & divestiture 132 Health Care, beginning of year $ 3,315 Acquistions & divestiture 27 Baby & Family Care, beginning of year $ 941 Acquistions & divestiture -- Total Health, Baby & Family Care, beginning of year $ 4,256 Acquistions & divestiture 27 Fabric & Home Care, beginning of year $ 614 Acquistions & divestiture 27 Snacks & Coffee, beginning of year $ 283 Acquistions & divestiture (25) Total Household Care, beginning of year $ 897 Acquistions & divestiture 2 Goodwill, Net, beginning of year $ 19,610 Acquistions & divestiture 161 The increase in goodwill from June 30, 2004 is primarily due to the completed allocation of the purchase price relating to the September 2003 acquisition of Wella AG and translation impacts.

Pro Forma Stock-Based Compensation - The Company has a primary stock-based compensation plan under which stock options are granted annually to key managers and directors with exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Grants were made under plans approved by shareholders in 1992, 2001 and 2003. Grants issued since September 2002 are vested after three years and have a ten-year life. Grants issued from July 1998 through August 2002 are vested after three years and have a fifteen-year life, while grants issued prior to July 1998 are vested after one year and have a ten-year life. The Company also makes other minor grants to employees, for which vesting terms and option lives are not substantially different. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" the Company has elected to account for its employee stock option plans under APB Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"" which recognizes expense based on the intrinsic value at date of grant. As stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date, no compensation cost has resulted. Had compensation cost for all options granted been determined based on the fair value at grant date consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows: Amounts in millions except per share data Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31 December 31 Net earnings per common share The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), ""Share-Based Payment"" (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement revises SFAS No. 123 by eliminating the option to account for employee stock options under APB No. 25 and generally requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the ""fair-value-based"" method). The Company plans to adopt SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005 using the modified retrospective method, whereby all prior periods will be adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. The impact of adopting SFAS 123 (R) will be consistent with the impact previously disclosed pursuant to the pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. 6. Postretirement Benefits - The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. Additional information about these benefits is",1419

The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of The amortization of intangible assets for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 is $51 million and $149 million, respectively. 5. Pro Forma Stock-Based Compensation - The Company has a primary stock-based compensation plan under which stock options are granted annually to key managers and directors with exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Grants were made under plans approved by shareholders in 1992, 2001 and 2003. Grants issued since September 2002 are vested after three years and have a ten-year life. Grants issued from July 1998 through August 2002 are vested after three years and have a fifteen-year life, while grants issued prior to July 1998 are vested after one year and have a ten-year life. The Company also makes other minor grants to employees, for which vesting terms and option lives are not substantially different. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" the Company has elected to account for its employee stock option plans under APB Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"" which recognizes expense based on the intrinsic value at date of grant. As stock options have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date, no compensation cost has resulted. Had compensation cost for all options granted been determined based on the fair value at grant date consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows: Amounts in millions except per share data THREE MONTHS ENDED NINE MONTHS ENDED Net earnings per common share The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. The Company has estimated the fair value of stock option grants after January 1, 2005 using a lattice-based model. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), ""Share-Based Payment"" (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement revises SFAS No. 123 by eliminating the option to account for employee stock options under APB No. 25 and generally requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the ""fair-value-based"" method). The Company plans to adopt SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005 using the modified retrospective method, whereby all prior periods will be adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be consistent with the impact previously disclosed pursuant to the pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. 6. Postretirement Benefits - The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. Additional information about these benefits is",1507

The closing of the transaction, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other conditions, is expected to occur in fall, 2005. P&G's Board of Directors and management are confident that combining P&G and Gillette will create substantial and sustainable shareholder value over the long term. Near term, the Company must focus on the successful integration of the Gillette business and delivery of growth and cost synergies, while maintaining momentum in the core businesses. The dilutive impact of the acquisition is expected to reduce P&G earnings by 25 to 35 cents per share in the first year following closing, and 5 to 10 cents per share in the second year following closing. In the third year following closing, the acquisition is expected to add 1 to 5 The near term impacts of the proposed transaction caused the Board's Compensation & Leadership Development Committee (""Committee"") to re-consider certain aspects of P&G's incentive compensation programs, during meetings on May 19, 2005 and June 14, 2005. Subject to closing of the transaction, the Committee approved at its June 14, 2005, meeting modifications to the Company's Short Term Achievement Reward Program (""STAR"") and Business Growth Program (""BGP"") as described below and in the documents attached hereto. STAR is the Company's annual incentive program. Awards are made within the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan, which dates back to 1949, and the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (""2001 Stock Plan). Historically, STAR awards have been based on two factors -- overall Company results and specific business unit results. In view of the importance of successfully integrating the Gillette acquisition, an additional factor will be used in determining STAR awards beginning fiscal year 2005/06. This 'Gillette Factor' will be determined by assessing performance during the fiscal year on various metrics related to integration goals including: sustaining the overall health of both the P&G and Gillette businesses during this period (based on market share and earnings progress); achieving sales, research and administrative budget and synergy objectives; meeting enrollment reduction targets; and staying within integration cost and restructuring estimates. This will put payments for all STAR participants at risk based on the achievement of integration goals. Under the revised STAR plan, participants may end up earning more or less than they would have without this change. BGP is a three-year performance program under the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan and the 2001 Stock Plan. Approximately 35 senior executive officers were included in BGP for the period from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007. Each was assigned a target amount for the performance period. Taken together, stock options at target and BGP at target represent total long-term incentive compensation equal to the median long-term incentive of P&G's compensation survey group for comparable positions. The Committee determines actual BGP awards based on an assessment of Company performance versus pre-established financial measures for diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") growth and operating total shareholder return (""OTSR""). The Committee believes P&G's compensation programs should continue to be directly linked to business results and remain consistent with shareholder interests following the Gillette merger. Accordingly, the Committee will discontinue the current three-year BGP cycle at the end of its first year (June 30, 2005). In its place, the Committee will establish a new three-year cycle, beginning July 1, 2005. The Committee will restart the program cycle so that senior management compensation for the combined company is linked more directly to the success of the Gillette integration. By starting a new BGP cycle, the Committee will ensure that management compensation reflects results of all the Company's businesses, including those acquired from Gillette. More specifically, management will be incented to minimize the dilution of EPS in the first two years following closing and deliver accretive EPS in the third year following closing. The program will pay out at target compensation levels for the full three-year period only if, by the third year following closing, the Company achieves its Operating Total Shareholder Return goal and delivers three-year 10% compound EPS growth for P&G's current business, while also achieving its accretion goal for Gillette. Consequently, management compensation will be at risk to achieve the profitable growth objectives of both Gillette and current P&G. Depending on actual results, participants may earn more or less than The Committee has approved funding formulas covering STAR and BGP awards to named executive officers. These formulas qualify the payments as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, thereby preserving tax deductibility. More detailed descriptions of STAR and BGP, as modified, are attached as Exhibit 10-1 hereto, together with related correspondence and grant ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT In connection with the proposed merger, The Procter & Gamble Company (""P&G"") has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 on May 26, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Registration No. 333-123309), containing a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement revises SFAS No. 123 by eliminating the option to account for employee stock options under APB No. 25 and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the ""fair-value-based"" method). We adopted SFAS 123(R) effective July 1, 2005 using the modified retrospective method. All prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. We provided revised Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflecting the adoption of SFAS 123(R) under the modified retrospective method in a Form 8-K dated November 2, 2005. The impact to the Company's net earnings of adopting SFAS 123(R) is consistent with the pro forma disclosures provided in previous financial statements. The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on Shareholders' Equity as of September 30, 2005, June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 is shown in Note 8. For the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, we recognized total share-based compensation of $95 million and $122 million, respectively, of which $73 million and $82 million relate to additional compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) for stock options, and $22 million and $40 million relate to compensation for other share-based awards, primarily restricted stock and restricted stock units. These amounts are reflected in Cost of Products Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expense and have been allocated to the reportable segments. The fair value of each grant issued since January 1, 2005 was estimated using a binomial lattice-based model. The fair value of options granted prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The utilization of the binomial lattice-based model did not have a significant impact on the valuation of stock options as compared to the Black-Scholes model. Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and 6.

The Company has elected to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective method under which prior years’ results will be revised to give effect to the value of options granted in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. In addition, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for Treasury Stock. The Company previously accounted for share repurchases as if the Treasury retired by reducing Common Stock and Retained Earnings within Shareholders’ Equity. Our new method of accounting will present Treasury Stock as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity. We believe that our new accounting method is preferable as it more closely depicts the underlying intent of the share repurchases.

Previously, KPMG LLP (""KPMG"") served as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Gillette Plans. On January 19, 2006, KPMG declined to stand for reelection in connection with an audit of the Gillette Plans starting with the annual audit of such plans for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. This change follows the merger between The Procter & Gamble Company (the ""Company"") and The Gillette Company. The Procter & Gamble Master Savings Plan Committee for The Gillette Company Employees' Savings Plan and the Gillette Employee Stock Ownership Plan Committee for The Gillette Company Global Employee Stock Ownership Plan each approved the appointment of Plante & Moran as the new independent registered public accounting firm to replace KPMG. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor its Audit Committee was involved in this decision as it does not change the principal independent registered public accounting firm responsible for auditing the financial statements of The Procter & Gamble Company. In connection with the audits of the Gillette Plans for the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, and the subsequent interim period through January 19, 2006, there were no disagreements with KPMG concerning accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement. The Company is not aware of any ""reportable events,"" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, during the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 in connection with the Gillette Plans. The audit reports of KPMG contained in the Annual Report on Form 11-K filed in connection with the Gillette Plans for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

We also refer to organic sales growth (net sales excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity, which are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details. Effective July 1, 2005, Procter & Gamble adopted SFAS 123(R) which requires that all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for using a fair value-based method. We have elected to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective method. As a result, we have revised our historical results to include the effect of stock-based compensation. Therefore, all financial data provided in this Form 10-Q filing, including prior year data, have been revised to include the impact of stock option compensation expense. Our business is focused on providing branded products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. We believe this will lead to leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette Company (""Gillette""), a leading consumer products company that had $10.5 billion of sales in its most recent year ended December 31, 2004. The results of Gillette are included in the Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended December 31, 2005. In order to provide our investors with more insight into the results of the Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun reporting segments, we have previously provided supplemental pro forma net sales and earnings data for these segments for each of the quarters in the Gillette Company's year ended June 30, 2005 (as presented in our Form 8-K released October 4, 2005). Management's discussion of the current quarter results of these two segments is in relation to such comparable prior year pro forma net sales and earnings data. Procter & Gamble markets approximately 300 consumer products in more than 160 countries. Our products are sold primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We compete in multiple product categories and have four global business units: P&G Beauty, P&G Family Health, P&G Household Care, and Gillette. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we have seven reportable segments: Beauty, Health Care, Baby Care & Family Care, Fabric Care & Home Care, Snacks & Coffee, Blades & Razors, and Duracell & Braun. We have operations in over 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas: North America, Western Europe, Northeast Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by business segment for the six months ended December 31, 2005 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Net Sales Net Earnings Baby Care and Family Care 18% 13% Fabric Care and Home Care 25% 25% Note: Calculations above are based on only 3 months of Gillette results The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three months ended December 31, 2005 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Net Sales Net Earnings Baby Care and Family Care 17% 12% SUMMARY OF RESULTS. Following are highlights of results for the six months o Unit volume increased 17 percent. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased seven percent. Growth was broad-based with every business unit and every geographic region delivering organic volume increases. o Net sales increased 17 percent to $33.13 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures, increased seven percent. o Net earnings increased 17 percent to $4.58 billion behind strong organic growth and the addition of the Gillette business, partially offset by increased commodity costs and acquisition-related expenses. o Diluted net earnings per share were $1.48, an increase of four percent versus the comparable prior year period. o Operating cash flow was $4.75 billion, an increase of 20 percent versus the prior year period.

Going forward, business and market uncertainties may affect results. Among the key factors that could impact results and must be managed by the Company are: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including with respect to lower income consumers and growing existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in which the Company has chosen to (2) the ability to successfully execute, manage and integrate key acquisitions and mergers, including (i) the Company's acquisition of The Gillette Company, including the ability to achieve the cost and growth synergies in accordance with the stated goals of the transaction and (ii), the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (3) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (4) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (6) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including the Company's outsourcing projects; (7) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries), debt (including debt related to the Company's announced plan to repurchase shares of the Company's stock), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; (8) the ability to manage the continued global political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in the Company's significant geographical markets, as well as any political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions due to terrorist activities; (9) the ability to successfully manage competitive factors, including prices, promotional incentives and trade terms for products; (10) the ability to obtain patents and respond to technological advances attained by competitors and patents granted to competitors; (11) the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the Company's products; (12) the ability to stay close to consumers in an era of increased media (13) the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation. If the Company's assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Company's actual results could vary materially from the forward-looking statements made herein, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2005 versus the three months ended December 31, 2004. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 5,713 4,585 25 % OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET 68 55 AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 3,547.0 2,752.1 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 31.2 % 31.7 % (50) Unit volume increased 27 percent during the December quarter driven by the addition of the Gillette business as well as organic volume growth. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from year-over-year comparisons, increased six percent. Every business segment except Snacks and Coffee, which was impacted by Hurricane Katrina, delivered mid-single digit or higher organic volume growth. In addition, each of the Company's geographic regions delivered organic growth, with developing regions growing organic volume in the mid-teens. Net sales for the quarter increased 27 percent to $18.34 billion. Organic sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange impacts, grew eight percent. Foreign exchange had a negative two percent impact on sales growth. Pricing and mix each had a positive one percent impact on sales growth.

The addition of the Gillette business added approximately 75 basis points to gross margin due to higher margins in the Blades and Razors segment, net of approximately 35 basis points of increased product costs from revaluing Gillette's opening inventory balances to fair value as of the acquisition date. The gross margin decline in our other businesses was caused primarily by higher commodity costs, which hurt gross margin by about 150 basis points in the quarter. Scale leverage, costs savings initiatives and pricing partially offset the increase in Total Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 25%, or $1.13 billion, during the quarter versus the prior year period. The addition of Gillette drove approximately $1.0 billion of the total increase in the quarter, including approximately $200 million of acquisition related expenses. The acquisition related expenses were comprised of $135 million due to increased intangible asset amortization resulting from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet of the acquired Gillette business. The balance of the acquisition related expenses was due to incremental integration and overhead expenses such as legal and consulting fees. Total SG&A also increased due to higher marketing and overhead spending on our base businesses (total company excluding Gillette and acquisition related expenses), although both were lower as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending increased in support of new initiatives across key brands including Tide, Crest, Olay, Pantene, Naturella, and LaCoste. SG&A decreased as percentage of sales by 50 basis points. Sales growth and the mix benefits of adding the Gillette businesses more than offset the impact of acquisition related expenses. Interest expense for the quarter increased $99 million versus the prior year period driven by the financing cost of the previously announced share repurchase program associated with the Gillette acquisition. We repurchased $3.5 billion of P&G stock during the quarter as part of this program. This brings the cumulative value of shares purchased under the program to $12.0 billion. Net earnings increased 29 percent to $2.55 billion. Earnings growth was driven by organic growth, the addition of Gillette, and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by commodity-driven increases in product costs. The contribution from Gillette was net of increased interest expense, higher costs from revaluing Gillette's opening asset balances to fair value as of the acquisition date and other one-time integration costs. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.72, in-line with comparable prior year period results. Earnings per share included an estimated $0.06-$0.07 cents per share of dilution related to the Gillette acquisition. The dilution estimate includes $0.03 of one-time charges, including costs from revaluing Gillette's opening inventory balances to fair value as of the acquisition date. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Six Months Ended December 31, 2005 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2005 versus the six months ended December 31, 2004.

Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased seven percent. Growth was broad-based across businesses and geographies. Every business segment except Snacks and Coffee, which was impacted by Hurricane Katrina, delivered mid-single digit or higher organic volume growth. In addition, each of the Company's regions delivered organic growth led by double-digit growth in For the first six months of the fiscal year, net sales increased 17 percent to $33.13 billion driven by the addition of the Gillette business as well as growth on the base P&G businesses. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased seven percent. Favorable product mix, resulting largely from the addition of the Gillette business offset the mix impact of disproportionate growth in developing regions where average selling price is lower than the global average. Pricing activity in Health Care, Baby and Family Care, Fabric and Home Care, and Snacks and Coffee had a positive one percent impact on sales growth. Foreign exchange was neutral during the period.

Adding the Gillette business added approximately 40 basis points to gross margin due to higher margins in the Blades and Razors segment, net of approximately 20 basis points of increased product costs from revaluing Gillette's opening inventory balances to fair value as of the acquisition date. Gross margin on the Company's base businesses declined by approximately 50 basis points driven by higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted gross margin by about 130 basis points. Scale benefits of volume growth, price increases and cost savings programs partially offset the increase in commodity costs. Total Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 15%, or $1.37 billion, fiscal year to date versus the prior year period. The addition of Gillette drove approximately $1.0 billion of the total increase in the period, including approximately $200 million of acquisition related expenses. The acquisition related expenses were comprised of $135 million due to increased intangible asset amortization resulting from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet of the acquired Gillette business. The balance of the acquisition related expenses was due to incremental integration and overhead expenses such as legal and consulting fees. Total SG&A also increased due to higher marketing and overhead spending on our base businesses (total company excluding Gillette and acquisition related expenses), although both were lower as a percentage of sales. SG&A decreased as percentage of sales by 50 basis points. Sales growth and the mix benefits of adding the Gillette businesses more than offset the impact of acquisition related expenses. Interest expense increased fiscal year to date by $137 million versus the prior year period driven by the financing cost of the previously announced share repurchase program associated with the Gillette acquisition. The Company repurchased $9.0 billion of P&G stock fiscal year to date under this program, bringing cumulative repurchases under the program to $12.0 billion since January Net earnings increased 17 percent to $4.58 billion behind organic growth, the impact of adding the Gillette business, and improved SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Diluted net earnings per share increased four percent to $1.48 compared during BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. An analysis of the results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 is provided compared to the same three and six month periods ended December 31, 2004. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net earnings by business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable prior year period: Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 % Change Before % Change % Change Net Versus Income Versus Net Versus Sales Year Ago Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago Six Months Ended December 31, 2005 % Change Before % Change % Change Net Versus Income Versus Net Versus Sales Year Ago Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago * Figures include Gillette results for the October - December quarter only Beauty volume increased nine percent during the quarter, including the addition of Gillette Personal Care. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased five percent. Skin Care delivered double digit volume growth behind product innovations including Olay Regenerist and Total Effects Cleansing. The Feminine Care business delivered volume growth in the upper-single digits behind Always softness innovations, scent line extensions, Naturella expansion, and continued growth of Tampax Pearl. Retail Hair Care volume was up mid-single digits. Growth in developing regions and in hair colorants behind innovations on Koleston, Wellaton, and Nice n' Easy was partially offset by a volume decrease in developed regions resulting primarily from the discontinuation of minor shampoo brands in the US. Cosmetics volume declined in the mid-single digits versus a base period that included pipeline shipments ahead of a major initiative launch. Net sales increased seven percent to $5.37 billion, including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings increased seven percent to $848 million. Volume growth was partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased marketing investments to support initiative programs, primarily in developing regions. Beauty volume increased eight percent fiscal year to date, including three months of results of Gillette Personal Care. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, increased six percent, led by double digit organic growth in developing regions. Volume growth was driven by initiative activity on Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Olay, Always, and Naturella. Net sales increased seven percent to $10.36 billion including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $1.63 billion. Volume growth was partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased marketing investments to support initiative programs, primarily in developing Health Care delivered 31 percent volume growth in the quarter, including the addition of Gillette Oral Care. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, increased eight percent. Volume increases on our base business were driven by Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health behind continued growth on Actonel and Prilosec OTC. Oral Care also grew behind Crest, which delivered double-digit organic volume growth, net of the impact of the Spinbrush divestiture required in order to obtain regulatory approval of the Gillette acquisition. Growth on Crest was driven by share increases in North America and continued strength in developing markets. Net sales increased 29 percent to $2.64 billion behind organic volume growth as well as the addition of Gillette Oral Care. Pricing had a positive one percent impact on sales growth from prior period increases on Actonel and Prilosec OTC. Foreign exchange had a negative one percent impact on sales growth. Product mix reduced sales by two percent due primarily to the impact of adding Gillette Oral Care, which has a lower average selling price than the balance of the segment, and the impact of disproportionate growth in developing regions, where average selling prices are lower than the balance of the segment. Net earnings increased 41 percent to $427 million behind volume growth, including the addition of Gillette Oral Care, and margin expansion on P&G's base business. Margins expanded primarily due to scale benefits of volume growth, favorable product mix and pricing. Fiscal year to date, Health Care volume increased 21 percent, including three months of Gillette Oral Care results. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 10 percent behind double digit growth in Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health and upper-single digit organic growth in Oral Care. Net sales grew 21 percent to $4.72 billion. Pricing on Actonel and Prilosec OTC had a positive one percent impact on sales. This was offset by a negative one percent mix impact due to adding Gillette Oral Care, which has a lower average selling price than the segment average, and the impact of disproportionate growth in developing regions, where average selling prices are lower than the balance of the segment. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 11 percent. Net earnings increased 40 percent to $763 million behind organic volume growth, the addition of Gillette Oral Care, and margin expansion on the base P&G business. Margins expanded primarily due to scale benefits of volume growth, favorable product mix Baby Care and Family Care delivered volume growth of five percent during the quarter. Volume increased behind product initiatives such as Pampers Full Motion in Western Europe and Bounty and Charmin ""Basic,"" as well as double digit growth in developing markets. Baby Care volume declined in developed regions due to high levels of competitive pricing activity in North America. Net sales increased two percent to $3.04 billion, including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing added one percent to sales growth, but was offset by a negative two percent product mix impact from growth in developing markets and Bounty and Charmin ""Basic,"" both of which have lower relative sales prices than the segment average. Net earnings declined five percent to $330 million versus the base period. Earnings in the quarter were negatively impacted by the increase in energy costs that followed the hurricanes last September and reduced volume in North America Baby Care, both of which also contributed to the decline in the segment's earnings margin. Baby Care and Family Care volume increased five percent fiscal year to date. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased six percent. Volume increased in both Baby Care and Family Care behind product initiatives and double digit growth in developing regions. Net sales increased four percent to $6.04 billion. Pricing had a positive one percent impact on sales but was offset by a negative two percent mix impact due to growth in mid-tier Basic products and disproportionate growth in developing regions. Net earnings declined one percent to $650 million as volume growth and pricing were offset by increased energy costs and unfavorable product mix. Fabric Care and Home Care delivered volume growth of seven percent for the quarter. Volume was driven by innovations such as Tide with Febreze, Tide Coldwater, Ariel Ion Power Gels, Cascade Action Packs, Febreze Air Effects and the expansion of Bold in Japan coupled with very strong customer support behind key initiatives. Fabric Care grew volume in the upper-single digits behind double digit global growth on Tide. Net sales increased eight percent to $4.08 billion, including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing in the Fabric Care and Home Care businesses added two points to sales growth. Favorable product mix, primarily due to disproportionate growth on Tide, added an additional one point to sales growth. Net earnings increased eight percent to $593 million. Earnings growth reflects top line progress, as well as cost savings and pricing to mitigate commodity price increases. Fiscal year to date, Fabric Care and Home Care volume increased seven percent behind innovations on Tide, Ariel, Dawn, Febreze, Downy, and Cascade. Net sales increased nine percent to $8.30 billion. Pricing, primarily in North America and Latin America, added two points to sales growth. Net earnings increased nine percent to $1.23 billion. Volume growth, pricing, and cost savings programs more than offset increased commodity costs. Snacks and Coffee results were impacted by Hurricane Katrina, which occurred in August 2005. The business experienced significant disruption and damages to our manufacturing facilities in New Orleans. Beginning in December, these facilities were fully operational. Snacks and Coffee volume grew three percent in the quarter, as a mid-single digit decline in Coffee volume partially offset growth in other businesses. Snacks volume was up mid-single digits. Sales were $927 million, an increase of 10 percent. Pricing actions taken in the prior year in response to rising coffee prices added 9 percent to sales, which was partially offset by 1 percent each from negative product mix and foreign exchange. Earnings declined 20% to $95 million, as sales growth was offset by increased costs related to Hurricane Katrina and negative product mix. Fiscal year to date, Snacks and Coffee volume declined one percent. Lower Coffee shipments following the hurricane more than offset growth in other businesses. Snacks volume was up mid-single digits in the period. Net sales increased three percent to $1.63 billion, including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing in Coffee added seven percent to sales. The mix effect of lower Coffee shipments had a negative two percent impact on sales. Earnings declined 15 percent to $168 million as sales growth was offset by negative product mix and increased costs, primarily related to Hurricane Katrina. ACQUIRED GILLETTE REPORTED SEGMENTS As disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette Company on October 1, 2005. This acquisition resulted in two new reportable segments for the Company: Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun. The Gillette Oral Care and Personal Care businesses were subsumed within the Health Care and Beauty reportable segments, respectively. Because the acquisition was completed in the current period, there are no results for these segments in our prior year period. In order to provide our investors with more insight into the results of the Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun reporting segments, we have previously provided supplemental pro forma net sales and earnings data for these segments for each of the quarters in the Gillette Company's year ended June 30, 2005 (as presented in our Form 8-K released October 4, 2005). Management's discussion of the current quarter results of these two segments is in relation to such comparable prior year pro forma net sales and earnings data. With respect to the earnings data, this analysis is based on Earnings before Income Taxes. The previously disclosed Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun pro forma information reconciled ""Profit from Operations,"" the measure used by Gillette in its historical filings, to Earnings before Income Taxes, the comparable measure used by the Company. Gillette did not allocate income tax expense to its reporting Blades and Razors sales increased six percent to $1.15 billion over the pro forma prior year quarter. Positive pricing of two percent offset a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Sales growth was driven by M3Power, Venus Vibrance, and Venus Disposables as well as continued consumer trade-up in developing markets. Earnings before income taxes increased 11 percent to $375 million versus previously published pro forma prior year results. Earnings increased behind sales, a more profitable product mix of replacement blades versus razors, price increases and lower overhead and manufacturing expenses, primarily as a result of savings realized from Gillette's Functional Excellence program. Earnings growth was also favorably impacted by base period charges for severance and other exit charges associated with Gillette's Functional Excellence program, the European Manufacturing Realignment program, and other asset write-downs. These earnings drivers were partially offset by acquisition-related expenses in the current period of $116 million (before-tax), including increased amortization expense from revaluing acquired fixed and intangible assets and increased product costs from revaluing opening inventory balances at fair value. Reported net earnings for the segment were $272 million. Duracell and Braun delivered one percent sales growth to $1.28 billion during the quarter. Volume growth was offset by a negative two percent impact from foreign exchange. A price increase on Duracell had a positive impact on segment sales, but was more than offset by a year-on-year increase in total promotion expenses in the segment; the net impact of pricing on segment sales was negative one percent. Duracell pricing in the U.S. continues to trend upwards following the list price increase taken in August 2005 and the roll-out across trade accounts. Duracell sales increased behind share growth, while Braun sales were driven by new product initiatives such as 360 Complete, Tassimo, and Contour. Earnings before income taxes increased 46 percent to $243 million versus previously published pro forma prior year results. Earnings growth was driven primarily by volume as well as lower overhead and manufacturing costs, primarily resulting from the Functional Excellence program. Earnings growth was also favorably impacted by base period charges for severance and other exit charges associated with Gillette's Functional Excellence program as well as other asset write-downs. These earnings drivers were partially offset by acquisition-related expenses in the current period of $43 million (before tax), including increased amortization expense from revaluing acquired fixed and intangible assets and increased product costs from revaluing opening inventory balances at fair value. Reported net earnings for the segment were $165 million. We expect earnings before income taxes growth indices to moderate in the second half of the fiscal year versus the quarter ended December 31, 2005. This is primarily due to the lapping of the Functional Excellence program benefits coupled with increased investments behind the Fusion blade system launch. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, certain restructuring charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested categories, including the juice business that was divested in August of 2004 and the Gillette brands (primarily Rembrandt and Right Guard) that will be divested as required by the Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Because both unconsolidated entities and less than 100 percent owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100 percent of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. The decline in net earnings for the quarter and year to date is primarily driven by the impact of the base period gain on the sale of the juice business and a current period increase in net interest expense due to the financing cost of the share repurchase program announced in connection with the Gillette acquisitions. Cash generated from operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2005 was $4.75 billion versus $3.96 billion in the comparable prior period. Strong earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred income taxes) generated $6.46 billion. This was partially offset by an increase in working capital items, primarily accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable increased to support business growth. Days sales in receivables were flat versus the comparable prior year period. Accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities days were down largely due to our continued efforts to accelerate payments to suppliers in order to maximize payment discounts. Inventory days on hand were down marginally resulting in a slight improvement to cash flow. Investing activities in the current year decreased cash by $402 million, compared to the prior year period when investing activities reduced cash by $1.01 billion. Acquisitions provided a net source of cash. A cash balance of $1.60 billion received in the Gillette acquisition, representing Gillette's cash balances at the acquisition date, was partially offset by cash used for other acquisitions, including settlement of a major portion of the Wella domination liability. Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales were 3.1 percent, in-line with the comparable prior year period. Total cash used by financing activities was $2.87 billion versus $1.23 billion in the comparable base period. Our net debt position increased by $7.34 billion, primarily to fund the share repurchase program associated with the acquisition of Gillette. This was offset by $9.03 billion of treasury purchases during the Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. ORGANIC SALES GROWTH. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the October - December 2005 quarter: Total Sales Growth 27% Foreign Exchange Impact 2% Acquisition/Divestiture Impact -21% Organic Sales Growth 8% The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period ended December 31, 2005: Total Sales Growth 17% Foreign Exchange Impact 0% Acquisition/Divestiture Impact -10% Organic Sales Growth 7% FREE CASH FLOW. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company's long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management.

2006-05-04,10-Q,0000080424-06-000067,"and Analysis of Financial Condition and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: o Results of Operations - Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 o Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended March 31, 2006 o Business Segment Discussion (three and nine months ended March 31, 2006) Throughout MD&A, we refer to several measures used by management to evaluate performance including unit volume growth, net sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth (net sales excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity, which are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details. Effective July 1, 2005, Procter & Gamble adopted SFAS 123(R) which requires that all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for using a fair value-based method. We have elected to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective method. As a result, we have revised our historical results to include the effect of stock-based compensation. Therefore, all financial data provided in this Form 10-Q filing, including prior year data, have been revised to include the impact of all stock-based compensation expense. Our business is focused on providing branded products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. We believe this will lead to leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette Company (""Gillette""), a leading consumer products company that had $10.5 billion of sales in its most recent year ended December 31, 2004. The results of Gillette are included in the Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis as of October 1, 2005. In order to provide our investors with more insight into the results of the Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun reporting segments, we have previously provided supplemental pro forma net sales and earnings data for these segments for each of the four quarters in the year ended June 30, 2005 (as presented in our Form 8-K released October 4, 2005). Management's discussion of the current quarter results of these two reporting segments is in relation to such comparable prior year pro forma net sales and Procter & Gamble markets approximately 300 consumer products in more than 160 countries. Our products are sold primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We compete in multiple product categories and have four global business units: P&G Beauty, P&G Family Health, P&G Household Care and Gillette. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we have seven reportable segments: Beauty, Health Care, Baby Care & Family Care, Fabric Care & Home Care, Snacks & Coffee, Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun. We have operations in over 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas: North America, Western Europe, Northeast Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India. On April 17, 2006, we announced a number of changes to certain of our key leadership positions, which also involved changes to our organization structure. These changes will impact our segment reporting. Specifically, Pet Health & Nutrition, which is part of our Health Care reporting segment, will become part of our Snacks & Coffee reporting segment. In addition, our commercial products organization, which primarily sells cleaning products directly to commercial end users, will be moved from Snacks & Coffee to our Fabric Care & Home Care segment. Our segment reporting will be revised to reflect these changes during the upcoming quarter ended June 30, 2006, at which time we will also revise our historical financial statements to reflect these changes. The accompanying financial statements and management discussion of operating results reflect the management and organization structure that existed prior to the changes The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by business segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): NET SALES NET EARNINGS Baby Care and Family Care 18% 13% Fabric Care and Home Care 24% 25% NOTE: CALCULATIONS ABOVE INCLUDE 6 MONTHS OF GILLETTE RESULTS (OCTOBER 1, 2005 - MARCH 31, 2006) The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2006 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): NET SALES NET EARNINGS Baby Care and Family Care 17% 14% SUMMARY OF RESULTS. Following are highlights of results for the nine months o Unit volume increased 18 percent fiscal year to date. Organic volume, which excludes the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, increased six percent. Growth was broad-based with every segment delivering volume growth, except Snacks and Coffee which was impacted by business disruptions due to Hurricane Katrina. Every region delivered organic volume growth, with double digit growth in developing regions. o Net sales increased 19 percent to $50.38 billion fiscal year to date, including Gillette results since October 1, 2005. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, o Net earnings increased 23 percent to $6.79 billion fiscal year to date. Net earnings increased behind the addition of Gillette and sales growth on our base business. o Diluted net earnings per share were $2.10 through the first nine months of the fiscal year, an increase of four percent versus the comparable prior year period, including $0.15 - $0.17 of dilution from o Operating cash flow was $8.19 billion, an increase of 24 percent versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity fiscal year FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. The markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and comprised of both global and local competitors. Going forward, business and market uncertainties may affect results. Among the key factors that could impact results and must be managed by the Company are: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including with respect to lower income consumers and growing existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in which the Company has chosen to focus; (2) the ability to successfully execute, manage and integrate key acquisitions and mergers, including (i) the Company's acquisition of The Gillette Company, including the ability to achieve the cost and growth synergies in accordance with the stated goals of the transaction and (ii), the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (3) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (4) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (6) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including the Company's outsourcing projects; (7) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries), debt (including debt related to the Company's plan to repurchase shares of the Company's stock), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; (8) the ability to manage the continued global political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in the Company's significant geographical markets, as well as any political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions due to terrorist activities; (9) the ability to successfully manage competitive factors, including prices, promotional incentives and trade terms for products; (10) the ability to obtain patents and respond to technological advances attained by competitors and patents granted to competitors; (11) the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the Company's products; (12) the ability to stay close to consumers in an era of increased media (13) the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation. If the Company's assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Company's actual results could vary materially from the forward-looking statements made herein, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2006 versus the three months ended March 31, 2005. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 5,559 4,690 19 % OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET 79 60 AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 3,510.5 2,730.3 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 32.2 % 32.8 % (60) Unit volume increased 22 percent during the March quarter driven by the addition of the Gillette business and organic volume growth. Organic volume, which excludes the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, increased five percent, largely behind product innovations that drove broad-based market share growth. Net sales for the quarter increased 21 percent to $17.25 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, grew six percent. Sales growth was broad-based across both developed and developing regions. Developing markets led sales growth, driven by increases in Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa behind market share improvements and new initiative introductions. China sales growth moderated versus prior periods' growth rates, but was still up mid to high-single digits excluding the impact of Gillette. Foreign exchange trends had a negative three percent impact on the Company's sales growth due primarily to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. Pricing and mix each had a positive one percent impact on sales growth. Acquisitions Acquisitions Total Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Other Impact Ex-FX NOTE: Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied Gross margin expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter to 51.7%. Commodity cost increases had a negative impact on gross margin of approximately 100 basis points. Scale leverage from volume growth, along with pricing and cost savings projects, offset the majority of the commodity cost increases. The mix benefit of adding the Gillette business drove approximately 125 basis points of gross margin expansion due to above company average margins in the Blades and Razors Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 19%, or $869 million, during the quarter versus the prior year period. The increase was driven by the addition of Gillette, which added approximately $900 million to SG&A in the period, including approximately $150 million of acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition-related expenses included $108 million of increased intangible asset amortization resulting from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet of the acquired Gillette business. The balance of the acquisition-related expenses was due to incremental integration and overhead expenses such as legal and consulting fees. Marketing spending on our base business (total Company excluding Gillette) increased behind investments in Fabric Care and Home Care and in Beauty to support initiative activity, but was down as a percentage of sales versus the comparable prior year period. Overhead spending on our base business also decreased as a percentage of sales driven largely by reduced Wella integration costs versus the base period. Overall, SG&A decreased as a percentage of sales by 60 basis points as sales growth, overhead cost control and the mix benefits of adding the Gillette business more than offset the increase in SG&A expense. Interest expense for the quarter increased by $79 million versus the prior year period driven by the financing cost of the previously announced share repurchase program associated with the Gillette acquisition. We repurchased $3.7 billion of P&G stock during the quarter as part of this program, including $2.2 billion of shares repurchased under a forward purchase agreement that settled in April 2006. This brings the cumulative value of shares repurchased under the program to $15.8 billion since January 2005. We expect to repurchase about $20 billion in total under the program and to complete the program by mid-calendar 2006. Net earnings increased 37 percent to $2.21 billion behind organic sales growth, the addition of Gillette, improvement in gross margin and SG&A as a percentage of sales and a reduced tax rate versus the comparable base period. The contribution from Gillette was net of increased interest expense, higher costs from revaluing Gillette's intangible assets to fair value as of the acquisition date and one-time integration costs. Net earnings also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. The Company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.3% compared to a rate of 32.2% in the comparable prior year period. The comparable prior year tax rate was negatively impacted by a provision for tax costs on anticipated dividends originating from foreign subsidiaries. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from the favorable settlement of a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.63, up seven percent versus the prior year, including an estimated $0.07-$0.08 per share of dilution from the Gillette acquisition. Net earnings per share benefited by about $0.01 per share due to the favorable tax settlement. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2005. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 15,849 13,607 16 % OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET 221 297 AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 3,235.4 2,749.4 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 31.5 % 32.0 % (50) Fiscal year to date, unit volume increased 18 percent. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased six percent behind broad-based growth across segments and geographies. Every business segment except Snacks and Coffee, which was impacted by Hurricane Katrina, delivered mid-single digit or higher organic volume growth. In addition, each of the Company's regions delivered organic volume growth, led by double digit growth in developing regions. Net sales increased 19 percent to $50.38 billion in the first nine months of the fiscal year driven by the addition of the Gillette business in October, 2005, as well as growth on the base P&G businesses. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased seven percent during the period. Favorable product mix, resulting from the addition of the Gillette business which has a unit selling price that is higher than the Company average, along with more favorable product mix in Beauty and in Health Care, added one percent to sales growth. Pricing increases, taken across most segments, also had a positive one percent impact on sales growth, but were offset by a negative one percent unfavorable foreign exchange trend. Acquisitions Acquisitions Total Divestitures Divestitures FX Price Other Impact Ex-FX NOTE: Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. * Figures include only six months of Gillette results (October 1, 2005 - March 31, 2006) Gross margin was 51.9 percent fiscal year to date, an increase of 30 basis points versus the comparable base period. Adding the Gillette business added approximately 70 basis points to gross margin due to higher margins in the Blades and Razors segment, net of approximately 15 basis points due to increased product costs from revaluing Gillette's opening inventory balances to fair value as of the acquisition date. Gross margin on the Company's base businesses declined approximately 40 basis points during the period. Higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted gross margin by about 120 basis points, were partially offset by the scale benefit from sales growth and cost savings Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 16 percent, or $2.2 billion fiscal year to date versus the prior year period. The addition of Gillette drove approximately $2.0 billion of the total increase in the period, including approximately $350 million of acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition-related expenses included $243 million of increased intangible asset amortization resulting from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet of the acquired Gillette business. The balance of the acquisition-related expenses was due to incremental integration and overhead expenses such as legal and consulting fees. Marketing spending on our base business (total Company excluding Gillette) increased behind investments in Fabric Care and Home Care and in Beauty to support initiative activity, but was down as a percentage of sales versus the comparable prior year period. Overhead spending on our base business also decreased as a percentage of sales driven largely by reduced Wella integration costs versus the base period. Overall, SG&A decreased as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points as sales growth, overhead cost control and the mix benefits of adding the Gillette businesses more than offset the increase in SG&A expense. Interest expense increased fiscal year to date by $216 million versus the prior year period driven by the financing cost of the previously announced share repurchase program associated with the Gillette acquisition. The Company repurchased $12.8 billion of P&G stock fiscal year to date under this program, including $2.2 billion of shares repurchased under a forward purchase agreement that settled in April 2006. This brings the cumulative value of shares repurchased under the program to $15.8 billion since January 2005. We expect to repurchase about $20 billion in total under the program and to complete the program by mid-calendar 2006. Net earnings increased 23 percent to $6.79 billion fiscal year to date behind the impact of adding the Gillette business, organic sales growth and improved SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Net earnings also benefited from a lower fiscal year to date effective tax rate as a result of a favorable resolution of a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction during the current March quarter, coupled with a tax provision in the comparable base period related to a planned repatriation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries. Diluted net earnings per share increased four percent to $2.10 during the period, including $0.15 - $0.17 of Gillette dilution. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. An analysis of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 is provided compared to the same three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2005. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 versus the comparable prior year period: Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 % Change Before % Change % Change Net Versus Income Versus Net Versus Sales Year Ago Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago Nine Months Ended March 31, 2006* % Change Before % Change % Change Net Versus Income Versus Net Versus Sales Year Ago Taxes Year Ago Earnings Year Ago * Figures shown include six months of Gillette results only (October 1, 2005 - March 31, 2006) Beauty volume increased eight percent during the quarter behind organic volume growth and the addition of Gillette Personal Care. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent with growth across multiple categories and double digit developing region growth. Skin Care volume increased double digits behind growth on Olay. Cosmetics volume decreased versus last year due to declines on Max Factor in North America resulting from reduced distribution. Retail Hair Care volume increased mid-single digits behind Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Rejoice. Beauty net sales increased six percent to $5.16 billion driven by volume growth and a favorable one percent product mix impact resulting from higher sales of premium Hair Care and Feminine Care products, partially offset by three percent of unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Net earnings in Beauty increased 10 percent to $738 million behind the addition of Gillette Personal Care, organic sales growth, reduced Wella integration costs and a more profitable product mix. These were partially offset by higher commodity costs and an increase in marketing investments behind initiative activity, primarily in developing regions. Beauty volume increased eight percent fiscal year to date, including six months of Gillette Personal Care results. Organic volume increased five percent, led by double digit growth in developing regions. Volume growth was driven by initiative activity across categories and brands including Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Olay, Always and Naturella. Net sales increased seven percent to $15.51 billion including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $2.37 billion. Sales growth and lower Wella integration costs were partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased marketing investments behind initiative activity, primarily in Health Care delivered 18 percent volume growth in the quarter, including the addition of the Gillette business. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, declined one percent despite market share increases across most businesses and regions. Year-on-year comparisons were negatively impacted by a base period in which volume grew 14 percent behind the rebuild of Prilosec OTC trade inventory following an allocation period. The prior year also benefited from a late flu season in North America and Western Europe. Despite volume declines, market shares grew in Oral Care, Respiratory and on Prilosec OTC. Net sales in Health Care grew 21 percent to $2.43 billion due primarily to the addition of Gillette Oral Care. Favorable product mix in Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health and within the base Oral Care business increased sales by three percent. In addition, previously announced price increases on Actonel and Prilosec OTC added one percent to sales growth, but were offset by one percent from unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Health Care net earnings increased 28 percent to $298 million primarily behind the addition of the Gillette Oral Care business and a 100 basis point operating margin expansion. Operating margin increased as a result of adding Gillette Oral Care coupled with pricing activity and lower marketing expenses as a percentage of Fiscal year to date, Health Care volume increased 20 percent, including six months of Gillette Oral Care results. Organic volume increased six percent behind upper-single digit growth in Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health and mid-single digit growth in Oral Care. Additionally, volume increased due to a suppressed July-December base period when Prilosec OTC was on shipment allocations. Net sales increased 21 percent to $7.15 billion including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing on Actonel and Prilosec OTC had a positive one percent impact on sales. Favorable product mix due to disproportionate growth in Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health added an additional one percent to sales. Net earnings increased 36 percent to $1.06 billion behind organic volume growth, the addition of Gillette Oral Care and margin expansion on the base P&G business. Operating margin in Health Care expanded by 220 basis points versus the comparable prior year period primarily due to scale benefits of sales growth, favorable product mix and a reduction in marketing expenses as percentage of sales versus the base period. Baby Care and Family Care volume increased two percent during the quarter, with organic volume up three percent. Baby Care volume increased in the low-single digits with developing regions up double digits behind market share growth in China and in Central and Eastern Europe. In developed regions, market share on Pampers in North America was in-line with the prior year period while continued pricing pressure from private label competitors drove share softness on the Luvs brand. Family Care organic volume grew in the mid-single digits, largely behind growth on Bounty and on the Charmin Basic initiative. Net sales in the Baby Care and Family Care segment were $3.03 billion, down one percent versus the prior year including a negative three percent foreign exchange impact. Previously announced price increases in North America Baby Care, coupled with a late January increase in North America Family Care, added two percent to sales. Disproportionate growth in mid-tier products and in developing regions, where average unit selling price is below the segment average, resulted in a negative two percent mix impact. Baby Care and Family Care net earnings increased two percent to $326 million. Operating margin increased 90 basis points as cost savings projects and lower marketing expenses as a percentage of sales offset higher commodity and energy costs. Baby Care and Family Care volume increased four percent fiscal year to date. Organic volume increased five percent behind product initiatives and double digit growth in developing regions. Net sales increased two percent to $9.07 billion, including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing had a positive one percent impact on sales. Product mix and higher growth rates in developing markets reduced sales by two percent. Net earnings were unchanged at $976 million as volume growth and price increases in the second and third quarter were offset by increased energy costs and unfavorable product mix. Fabric Care and Home Care volume grew seven percent during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across regions and across both Fabric Care and Home Care. Volume was driven by innovations such as Tide with Febreze, Febreze Noticeables, Gain Joyful Expressions, Bounce with Febreze and Bold Liquid Tabs. Net sales increased seven percent to $4.08 billion, including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing activity, primarily in Latin America Fabric Care and North America Dish Care, added two percent to sales growth. Net earnings increased thirteen percent to $545 million behind sales growth and margin expansion. Operating margin expanded by 100 basis points as volume growth, cost savings initiatives and pricing activity offset commodity cost increases and increased marketing investments behind initiative activity. Fiscal year to date, Fabric Care and Home Care volume increased seven percent driven by initiative activity across the segment. Net sales increased eight percent to $12.38 billion, including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing activity added two percent to sales growth. Net earnings increased 10 percent to $1.78 billion. Volume growth, pricing and cost savings programs more than offset increased commodity costs and increased marketing spending behind initiative activity. Snacks and Coffee volume grew three percent in the quarter. Coffee volume increased mid-single digits as Folgers market share, which was impacted by disruptions related to Hurricane Katrina, returned to pre-hurricane levels during the quarter. Snacks volume was flat versus the prior year. Net sales for the segment were $796 million, an increase of four percent including a negative two percent impact from unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Previously announced price increases in Coffee added three percent to sales growth. Earnings were up 12 percent to $109 million driven by sales growth and an insurance recovery from Hurricane Katrina, which more than offset current quarter hurricane-related costs. Fiscal year to date, Snacks and Coffee volume was flat, primarily due to Coffee shipment disruptions following Hurricane Katrina. Coffee volume was down double digits while Snacks volume was up in the low-single digits during the period. Net sales increased three percent to $2.43 billion, including a negative one percent foreign exchange impact. Pricing in Coffee added six percent to sales while the mix effect of lower Coffee shipments had a negative two percent impact on sales. Earnings declined six percent to $277 million as sales growth was offset by increased costs related to Hurricane Katrina (net of the insurance recovery), negative product mix and higher green coffee prices. ACQUIRED GILLETTE REPORTED SEGMENTS As disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette Company on October 1, 2005. This acquisition resulted in two new reportable segments for the Company: Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun. The Gillette Oral Care and Personal Care businesses were subsumed within the Health Care and Beauty reportable segments, respectively. Because the acquisition was completed during the current fiscal year period, there are no results for these segments in our prior year period. In order to provide our investors with more insight into the results of the Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun reporting segments, we have previously provided supplemental pro forma net sales and earnings data for these segments for each of the quarters in the Gillette Company's year ended June 30, 2005 (as presented in our Form 8-K released October 4, 2005). Management's discussion of the current quarter results of these two segments is in relation to such comparable prior year pro forma net sales and earnings data. With respect to the earnings data, this analysis is based on Earnings before Income Taxes. The previously disclosed Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun pro forma information reconciled ""Profit from Operations,"" the measure used by Gillette in its historical filings, to Earnings before Income Taxes, the comparable measure used by the Company. Gillette did not allocate income tax expense to its Blades and Razors sales increased one percent during the quarter to $1.19 billion versus prior year pro forma results, including a negative two percent foreign exchange impact. The launch of Fusion in North America led to an increase in sales in the region but was partially offset by a decline in Western Europe. In Western Europe, sales were down versus the prior year period despite market share growth. This was due to a base period in which sales grew in the mid-teens behind the launch of M3Power and Venus Disposables. Sales in the current quarter were also negatively impacted by a reduction in distributor inventory levels in several developing countries in Asia where the Gillette business was integrated into existing P&G distributors. Sales in Latin America increased behind continued growth on Mach3 Turbo and Prestobarba Excel. Overall, volume/mix increased sales by two percent and previously announced pricing activity added one percent to sales growth. Earnings before income taxes were $361 million, down 17 percent versus the published prior year pro forma results due primarily to $87 million of acquisition-related charges that negatively impacted earnings by 20 percent. The acquisition-related charges primarily represented increased amortization charges from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet. Earnings benefited from sales growth in North America and synergy savings from overhead cost reductions, largely offset by increased marketing investment behind the Fusion launch and the sales declines in Western Europe and Asia. Net earnings for the segment were $265 million in the quarter. Sales for Blades and Razors since the acquisition closed on October 1, 2005 have increased 4% to $2.34 billion versus the comparable prior year period pro forma results, including negative two percent of unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Sales grew behind the launch of Fusion in North America and growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, but were partially offset by a decline in Western Europe due to a base period that included the launch of M3Power and Venus Disposables. Sales were also impacted by a reduction in distributor inventory levels in several developing Asian countries where the Gillette business was integrated into existing P&G distributors. Earnings before income tax declined by 5 percent to $736 million, including $203 million of acquisition-related charges that negatively impacted earnings by 26 percent during the period. The acquisition-related charges primarily represented increased amortization charges as a result of revaluing Gillette's opening balance sheet to fair market value and increased product costs from revaluing opening inventory balances at fair value. Earnings were also impacted by an increase in the current year marketing investment behind the launch of Fusion offset by synergy savings from overhead cost reductions and base period charges for severance and other exit charges associated with Gillette's Functional Excellence program, the European Manufacturing Realignment program and other asset write downs. Fiscal year to date, net earnings were $537 million (since the acquisition closed on October 1, 2005). Duracell and Braun sales were $763 million in the quarter, down one percent versus the prior year pro forma results including three percent of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In the Duracell business, market share growth and price increases taken in North America to compensate for rising commodity costs were more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange trends, competitive activity in Western Europe and unfavorable mix due to a trend toward larger pack sizes. Braun sales increased in North America behind Tassimo, but were partially offset by competitive activity in Germany and unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Overall, volume/mix and pricing each contributed one percent to segment sales growth, but were offset by negative three percent of unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Earnings before income taxes increased one percent to $76 million, including acquisition-related charges of $10 million that negatively impacted earnings by 13 percent. The acquisition-related charges primarily represented increased amortization charges for revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet. Earnings grew ahead of sales primarily because of base period charges for the shutdown of a manufacturing facility and synergy savings from overhead cost reductions. In addition, current period cost savings resulting largely from the Gillette Functional Excellence program more than offset the effect of increased commodity costs. Net earnings for the segment were $54 million in the quarter. Sales for Duracell and Braun since the acquisition closed on October 1, 2005 have increased one percent to $2.04 billion versus the comparable prior year period pro forma results, including negative two percent of unfavorable foreign exchange trends. Market share growth and pricing activity on Duracell, coupled with successful growth on Braun behind initiative launches, were largely offset by unfavorable foreign exchange trends and declines in Western Europe due to competitive activity. Earnings before income tax increased 32 percent to $319 million, including acquisition-related charges of $53 million that negatively impacted earnings by 23 percent in the period. The acquisition-related charges primarily represented increased amortization charges as a result of revaluing Gillette's opening balance sheet to fair market value and increased product costs for revaluing opening inventory balances at fair value. Earnings growth was favorably impacted by base period charges for severance and other exit costs associated with Gillette's Functional Excellence program, including charges related to the shutdown of a manufacturing facility, as well as current-year synergy savings from overhead cost reductions. Fiscal year to date, net earnings were $219 million (since the acquisition closed on October 1, 2005). Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, certain restructuring charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested categories, including the Juice business that was divested in August of 2004 and any Gillette brands that were divested as required by the Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Because both unconsolidated entities and less than 100 percent owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100 percent of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. Net losses in the Corporate segment improved from -$185 million to -$124 million in the quarter due primarily to lower income taxes and a favorable legal settlement reached during the quarter. Income taxes benefited from the favorable resolution of a foreign tax audit in the current quarter, coupled with a provision taken in the comparable prior year period for tax costs on anticipated dividends originating from foreign subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in net interest expense due to the financing cost of the share repurchase program announced in connection with the Gillette acquisition. Fiscal year to date earnings in the Corporate segment declined by $160 million primarily due to impact of the base period gain on the sale of the Juice business and a current period increase in net interest expense, partially offset by the favorable tax settlement in the current quarter. Cash generated from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 was $8.19 billion versus $6.59 billion in the comparable prior year period, an increase of $1.60 billion. Cash increased behind earnings adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation and deferred income taxes), partially offset by working capital items. Changes in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $582 million of cash due primarily to spending against Gillette accruals. Inventory and accounts receivable increases in support of business growth were both net uses of cash. Both inventory and receivable days on hand were roughly flat over the fiscal year to date period, excluding the impact of Gillette. Investing activities in the current year decreased cash by $607 million, compared to the prior year period when investing activities reduced cash by $1.60 billion. Acquisitions provided a net source of cash. A cash balance of $1.60 billion received in the Gillette acquisition, representing Gillette's cash balances at the acquisition date, was partially offset by cash used for other acquisitions, including settlement of a major portion of the Wella domination liability. Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales were 3.3 percent, in-line with the comparable prior year period. Total cash used by financing activities was $5.36 billion versus $2.39 billion in the comparable base period. Our net debt position increased by $6.76 billion, primarily to fund the share repurchase program associated with the acquisition of Gillette. This was offset by $10.60 billion of treasury purchases during the Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. ORGANIC SALES GROWTH. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the January - March 2006 quarter and for the fiscal year to date: Acquisition/Divestiture Impact (18)% (13)% FREE CASH FLOW. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company's long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management.

In April 2006, the Company announced a number of changes to certain key leadership positions, which resulted in changes to its organization structure and segment reporting. Specifically, Pet Health & Nutrition, which was formerly part of the Health Care segment, became part of the Snacks and Coffee segment. The balance of the Health Care segment was moved under the P&G Beauty Global Business Unit (GBU), but will continue to be reported as a separate segment. In addition, the commercial products group, which primarily sells products to commercial end users, was moved from Snacks and Coffee to the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. Finally, the Adult Incontinence business was moved from Baby Care and Family Care to P&G Beauty. The balance of the Baby Care and Family Care reporting segment was moved from the P&G Family Health GBU to the P&G Household Care GBU and will continue to be reported as a separate reporting segment. In conjunction with these changes, the P&G Beauty GBU was renamed ""Beauty and Health"", the Snacks and Coffee reporting segment was renamed ""Pet Health, Snacks and Coffee"", the P&G Household Care GBU was renamed ""Household Care"" and the Family Health GBU was eliminated.

The repurchase program was completed during the first quarter of the fiscal year. We repurchased $20.1 billion of shares under the program since its inception. non-operating income increased during the fiscal year to date period by $117 million versus the base year period primarily as a result of the gains of the sale of Pert in North America and Sure and higher earnings increased 22 percent to $5.56 billion behind organic sales growth, the impacts from the addition of Gillette, including acquisition-related expenses, and profit margin expansion.

Unit volume grew two percent while organic volume Pharmaceuticals and personal health volume increased double-digit growth on Prilosec OTC as a result of market share growth and a low base period. In the year ago period, Prilosec OTC shipments were reduced as a result of a customer inventory build in the preceding increase. Oral care volume was flat globally as double-digit growth in developing regions behind market share gains was offset by a decline in developed regions. Developed region oral care volume was impacted by heavy competitive promotional activity, trade inventory adjustments in North America due to the August 2006 launch of Crest Pro Health and the base period launch of Crest Whitestrips Renewal and the divestiture of Spinbrush. Pricing taken in prior periods in pharmaceuticals and personal health contributed a positive two percent to segment sales growth while a more premium product mix added one percent. Foreign exchange had a positive two percent impact on sales growth. Net earnings grew 22 percent to $472 million during the quarter behind sales growth and a 250-basis point earnings margin improvement. Earnings margin increased behind volume scale leverage, lower product costs year-on-year Gillette acquisition-related expenses and Gillette synergy savings, which drove a reduction in overhead spending Care net sales were $4.58 billion fiscal year to date, up 18% versus the comparable prior year period.

Earnings volume scale leverage, lower year-on-year Gillette acquisition-related expenses, lower product costs in personal health care and Gillette synergy savings, which more than offset the negative mix impact on gross margin from the addition of the Gillette oral care business. Care and Home Care net sales increased 11 percent during the quarter to $4.68 billion behind eight percent volume growth. Volume was up double-digits in home care and high-single digits in fabric care behind recently launched initiatives including Tide Simple Pleasures, Gain Joyful Expressions, several Swiffer restages, Febreze Noticeables, Cascade Action Pacs and the Fairy Auto Dish expansion in Western Europe. Previously executed price increases contributed one percent to sales growth while favorable foreign exchange had a two percent positive impact. Net earnings increased nine percent to $673 million. Profit margin was down 20-basis points due to reduced gross margins as scale benefits of volume growth and manufacturing cost savings projects were offset by higher commodity costs. The gross margin decline was partially offset by lower overhead costs as a percentage of sales. Care and Home Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 10 percent to $9.43 billion behind eight percent volume growth. Volume growth was broad-based across regions with mid-single digit increases in developed growth in developing regions. Both fabric care and home care grew volume high-single digits behind product initiatives such as Tide Simple Pleasures, Gain Joyful Expressions, Febreze Noticeables, upgrades on Swiffer and the launch of Fairy auto-dishwashing in Western Europe. The impact of previously executed price increases, primarily in Latin America fabric care and in North America dish care, added one percent to sales while disproportionate developing regions drove a negative one percent mix impact. Foreign exchange had a positive two percent impact on sales growth. Net earnings increased 12 percent to $1.43 billion behind sales growth and a 20-basis earnings margin. Margin improved as the scale benefits of volume growth, cost savings programs and lower overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales more than offset higher commodity costs. and Family Care net sales increased five percent to $3.12 billion during the quarter. Unit volume grew two percent behind mid-single digit growth in baby care. Baby care volume increased high-single digits in developing regions behind market share growth in Greater China and in Central developed regions, baby care volume was up low-single increased in North America behind growth on Baby Stages of Development and the Caterpillar stretch initiative on Pampers Baby Dry. This growth was partially offset by soft results on Pampers in Western Europe and Luvs in North America caused by low pricing of both branded and private label competitors.

Favorable foreign exchange added two percent to sales growth. Net earnings in Baby Care and Family Care increased 11 percent fiscal year to date to $724 million. Earnings increased behind sales growth and a 60-basis point improvement in net earnings margin. Earnings margin expansion was driven by both improved gross margins and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. SG&A improved as a result of lower overhead and marketing expenses as a percentage of Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased three percent during the quarter to $1.25 billion. Volume was up one percent behind mid-single digit growth on coffee, partially offset by a decline on pet care. Coffee volume grew over a base period that included reduced shipments due to Hurricane Katrina and behind Folgers Simply Smooth and Gourmet Selections. Snacks volume was in-line with the prior year period as growth behind the Pringles Minis and Gourmet initiatives was offset by a four percent contraction in the North America chips market and heavy competitive merchandising activity. Disproportionate more premium product mix in snacks drove a positive one percent mix impact while favorable foreign exchange added one percent to sales. Net earnings increased 34 percent to $150 million during the quarter. Earnings increased as a result of sales growth and incremental base period costs Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased six percent fiscal year to date to $2.32 billion behind three percent volume growth. Coffee volume increased more than 20 percent during the period due to a base period that included a significant reduction in the coffee business from the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the recent launches of Folgers Simply Smooth and Gourmet Selections. Volume growth on coffee was partially offset by a decline in snacks due to customer inventory adjustments in Western Europe following the World events, market contraction in the U.S. and strong competitive activity. Pet care volume was in-line with the year ago period. Disproportionately high growth in coffee drove a positive two percent mix impact on sales while favorable foreign exchange added one percent to sales. Net earnings increased 26 percent to $237 million fiscal year to date. Earnings increased primarily due to base period impacts related to Hurricane Katrina. disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette Company on October 1, 2005. This acquisition resulted in two new reportable segments for the Company: Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun. The Gillette oral care and personal care businesses were subsumed within the Health Care and Beauty reportable Because the acquisition was completed in October 2005, there are no results for these segments in our base July-September 2005 to provide our investors with more insight into the results of the Blades and Razors and Duracell and Braun reporting segments, we have previously provided supplemental pro forma net sales and earnings data for these segments for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 (as presented in our Form 8-K released November 22, 2005). Management’s discussion of the current quarter results is to the comparable prior year reported net sales and net earnings results. The fiscal year to date results of these two segments is in relation to comparable prior year results including pro forma net sales and earnings data for the July - September 2005 period and reported results for the October - December 2005 period. With respect to the earnings data, the fiscal year to date analysis is based on earnings before income taxes. The previously Razors and Duracell and Braun pro forma information Operations,” the measure used by Gillette in its historical before Income Taxes, the comparable measure used by the Company. Gillette did not allocate income tax expense to its reporting segments. in Blades and Razors increased 11 percent to $1.28 billion during the quarter. Sales grew primarily behind the Fusion launch in developed regions and on Mach 3 in developing regions. Unit volume increased four percent during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in developing regions. Price increases and a more premium product mix each added two percent to sales growth while favorable foreign exchange added three percent. Net earnings increased 11 percent during the quarter to $301 million. Net earnings grew behind higher sales and lower acquisition-related expenses partially offset by higher marketing investment behind Fusion and higher year-on-year overhead expenses driven by a low level of base period overhead expenses. Acquisition-related expenses decreased primarily due to base period product costs resulting from revaluing Gillette’s opening balance sheet inventory balance. in Blades and Razors increased 11 percent fiscal year to date to $2.58 billion versus the comparable pro forma prior year period. Net sales increased behind higher consumption of Gillette blades and razors and pipeline inventory builds to support the Fusion launch. Overall, volume/mix increased eight percent during the period and favorable foreign exchange added three percent to sales growth. Earnings before income taxes increased 15 percent to $867 million versus the comparable prior year pro forma results, including $63 million of incremental acquisition-related charges in the current fiscal year period that negatively impacted earnings before income taxes by eight acquisition-related charges are comprised of amortization charges from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet, partially offset by base period product costs related to revaluing Gillette’s opening balance sheet inventory balance. Amortization charges are higher in the current fiscal year to date period due to the extra three months of Gillette post-acquisition results in the current period. Earnings grew as a result of sales growth, synergy savings and base period asset write-offs, partially offset marketing investment behind Fusion and acquisition-related were $638 million fiscal year to date. in Duracell and Braun increased five percent to $1.35 billion. Unit volume was flat with organic volume up one percent. Duracell low-single digits as growth in developing regions softness in North America and Western Europe from strong competitive activity. Braun volume was down slightly due to the divestiture pressure devices, a lower level of category promotion activity in North America during the 2006 holiday period versus the prior year period and a strong base period in Western Europe that included the launch of Tassimo in Germany. The Duracell and Braun business was impacted by one-time supply disruptions during systems cutover at a warehousing facility in the United States during a key holiday shipment period. The issue was completely resolved during the quarter and shipments capabilities returned to full capacity. A more premium product mix contributed two percent to segment sales growth while favorable foreign exchange had a positive three percent impact. Net earnings increased 32 percent during the quarter to $218 million. Earnings growth was driven by the increase in net sales and lower acquisition-related expenses Acquisition-related expenses decreased primarily due to base period product costs resulting from revaluing Gillette’s opening balance sheet in Duracell and Braun increased six percent fiscal year to date to $2.32 billion versus the comparable prior year pro forma results. In Duracell, sales increased mid-single digits globally behind double-digit growth in developing regions partially offset by reduced sales in developed regions which were impacted by strong competitive activity from both private label and branded competitors. In Braun, sales increased mid-single digits as the launch of 360 Complete and Contour razors in North America and Pulsonic razors in Germany and Japan more than offset softness in Western Europe household appliances, lower year-on-year holiday promotion activity in North America and the divestiture of thermometer and blood pressure devices. Overall, volume/mix in the Duracell and Braun segment increased four percent. Favorable foreign exchange added two percent to sales growth. Earnings before income taxes increased 17 percent fiscal year to date to $463 million versus the comparable prior year period pro forma results. Earnings grew behind sales growth and lower year-on-year expenses. Acquisition-related charges were down primarily due to base period product costs related to revaluing Gillette opening level, which more than offset the impact of an additional three months of amortization charges in current year period from revaluing intangible assets in the opening balance sheet. Net earnings were $313 million fiscal year to includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested categories, including certain Gillette brands that were divested in fiscal 2006 as required by the regulatory authorities Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Because both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. decline in net earnings for the quarter and the fiscal year to date period was primarily driven by increased interest expenses and higher restructuring and integration costs. Interest expense was up due to the financing costs of the share repurchase program announced in connection with the Gillette acquisition. The increase in restructuring expense is primarily related to costs incurred as part of the Gillette integration. These fiscal year to date cost increases were partially offset by the first quarter gains on the sale of Pert in North America generated fiscal year to date from operating activities was $5.40 billion versus $4.75 billion in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, and deferred income taxes) were partially offset by an increase in working capital. Accounts receivable increased due to seasonality primarily behind our Prestige fragrance impacts related to the Gillette integration. Inventory increased primarily to support business growth and upcoming initiative activities in the current year used $623 million, compared to the prior year period cash use of $402 million. Acquisitions used $139 million of cash behind several small acquisitions versus a net source of cash of $249 million in the prior year period from receiving Gillette’s cash balance, which more than offset funding related to the settlement of a major portion of the Wella Domination liability. Investment securities generated $620 million due to an investment shift from auction rate securities to cash equivalent expenditures were $1.24 billion, or 3.2 percent of net sales during the fiscal cash used by financing activities was $6.64 billion fiscal year to date versus $2.87 billion in the comparable prior year period. We repurchased $2.71 billion of treasury shares and reduced our debt position by $2.61 billion in the current year period. In the prior year period, we repurchased $9.03 billion of treasury shares funded in part by increases in our debt position of $7.34 billion. Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.61 billion. The key driver was the refinancing of a portion of our long-term credit facility with commercial paper. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long- and short-term ratings which will refinance this debt at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse financial institutions that, if needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic Acquisition/Divestiture Impact reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to Acquisition/Divestiture Impact cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management.

Total comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 was $4,113 million and $2,663 million, respectively. Segment Information — Following is a summary of segment results. In May 2007, we announced a number of changes to our organization structure and certain of our key leadership positions. The changes became effective on July 1, 2007 and resulted in changes to our GBU and reporting segment structure. The businesses that previously comprised the Gillette GBU are now included within the Beauty and Household Care GBUs. The Braun business has been combined with the Blades & Razors business to form the Grooming reportable segment within the Beauty GBU. The Grooming reportable segment also includes all face and shave prep products which were previously reported within the Beauty reportable segment. Duracell was moved to our Household Care GBU and will be reported as part of our Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. Finally, our feminine care business, which previously was part of our Beauty GBU and reportable segment, is now part of our Health and Well-Being GBU and will be reported as part of the Health Care reportable segment. The following segment information reflects the new segment reporting structure. Three Months Ended September 30 The Company acquired the Gillette Company in October 2005. At that time, we recognized an assumed liability for Gillette exit costs of $1.23 billion, including $854 million in separations related to approximately 5,500 people, $55 million in employee relocation costs and $320 million in other exit costs. These costs are primarily related to the elimination of selling, general and administrative overlap between the two companies in areas like Global Business Services, corporate staff and go-to-market support, as well as redundant manufacturing capacity. As of September 30, 2007, the remaining liability was $548 million. Total integration plan charges against the assumed liability were $68 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. We expect such activities to be substantially complete by June 30, 2008. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — Goodwill as of September 30, 2007 is allocated by reportable segment and global business unit as follows (amounts in millions): Beauty, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 Grooming, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 Health Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 Fabric Care and Home Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 Baby Care and Family Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 GOODWILL, NET, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2007 The increase in goodwill from June 30, 2007 is primarily due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets as of September 30, 2007 are comprised of (amounts in Amortizable intangible assets with Intangible assets with indefinite Total identifiable intangible assets Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology, and customer relationships. The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 was $157 million and $163 million, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment”, companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the “fair-value-based” method). Total share-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): Total Share-Based Compensation Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. Postretirement Benefits — The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) For the year ending June 30, 2008, the expected return on plan assets is 7.4% and 9.3% for defined benefit and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. On July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48). FIN 48 addresses the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The difference between the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a position in accordance with FIN 48 and the tax benefit claimed in the tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a decrease to retained earnings as of July 1, 2007 of $232 million, which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, with a corresponding increase to the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The impact primarily reflects the accrual of additional statutory interest and penalties as required by FIN 48, partially offset by adjustments to existing unrecognized tax benefits to comply with FIN 48 measurement principles. The implementation of FIN 48 also resulted in a reduction in our net tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions accounted for under purchase accounting, resulting in an $80 million decrease to goodwill. Additionally, the Company historically classified unrecognized tax benefits in current taxes payable. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, unrecognized tax benefits not expected to be paid in the next 12 months were reclassified to other non-current liabilities. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at July 1, 2007 is $2,971 million, excluding any related accruals for interest and penalties. Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits is $1,893 million that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. interest and penalties as of July 1, 2007 were $589 million and $128 million, respectively, on an after tax basis. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interests and penalties that are expected to be paid in the next 12 months are not P&G files income tax returns in multiple federal, state and local US and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions, with open tax years generally ranging from 1997 and forward. The Company has on-going audits in various stages of completion in several jurisdictions, one or more of which might conclude within the next 12 months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty at this time. Such settlements will involve some or all of the following: the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits. It is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months related to the audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. The unrecognized tax benefits described above will be included in the Company’s annual Form 10-K contractual obligations table to the extent the Company is able to make reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. If not, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will be disclosed in a footnote to the contractual obligations table. At this time, the Company can not make a reliable estimate as to the timing of cash settlements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations — Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 Business Segment Discussion — Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We have also expanded our presence in “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in over 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Northeast Asia) and four developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India). The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2007 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2007: Net sales grew eight percent to $20.2 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased five percent. Unit volume increased five percent. Every reportable segment and each of our geographic regions delivered year-on-year volume growth. Net earnings increased 14 percent to $3.1 billion. Net earnings increased behind sales growth, operating profit margin improvement and a one-time tax benefit. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, an increase of 16 percent versus the comparable prior year period. This included a $0.02 per share, or two percent, benefit from a one-time tax benefit incurred during the quarter. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion, an increase of nine percent versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity was 87 percent for the quarter, roughly in-line with the year-ago period. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the Gillette and Wella acquisitions, including achieving the cost and growth synergies in accordance with stated goals. Cost Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Global Economic Conditions. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent and intellectual property matters, as well as those related to the integration of Gillette and its subsidiaries) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2007 versus the three months ended September 30, 2006. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Net sales for the quarter were up eight percent to $20.2 billion. Sales growth was broad-based with all reportable segments delivering six percent or higher sales growth. Unit volume increased five percent for the quarter led by high single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Home Care and in Baby Care and Family Care. Each geographic region posted year-on-year volume growth, led by double-digit growth in developing regions. Volume grew behind initiative activity, led by Tide, Downy, Febreze, Fusion, Head & Shoulders, Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, Naturella, Pampers, Charmin and Pringles, all of which posted high-single digit or higher volume growth to offset softness in Braun and pet care. There was no net mix impact for the quarter as positive product mix resulting from a continued shift towards premium products was offset by disproportionate growth in developing regions, where average unit selling prices are below the Company average. Foreign exchange had a positive three percent impact on sales growth. Organic sales increased five percent for the Net Sales Change Drivers 2007 vs. 2006 (Three Months Ended Sept. 30) Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Fabric Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently Gross margin was up 10-basis points for the quarter to 52.9% of net sales. Commodity cost increases had a negative impact on gross margin of approximately 80-basis points but were more than offset by scale leverage from volume growth and cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased seven percent to $6.3 billion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down 20-basis points as lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales more than offset higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales was down primarily due to volume scale leverage, overhead cost controls and Gillette synergy savings. Interest expense for the quarter was roughly in-line with the year-ago period. Other non-operating income was also roughly in-line with the prior year. The base period included a gain on the sale of Pert in North America and Sure, while the current period includes a gain on the sale of our adult incontinence business in Japan. Net earnings increased 14 percent to $3.1 billion behind sales growth, operating profit margin expansion and a reduction in our tax rate. Our tax rate was down from 30.4% to 27.6% due to a reduction in our going rate from a shift in the mix of earnings to lower tax rate countries and a one-time tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the German statutory tax rate, which reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, up 16 percent versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share included a $0.02 per share, or two percent impact, from the one-time tax benefit. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION — Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2007 are provided compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2006. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2007 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Beauty net sales increased six percent during the quarter to $4.6 billion. Sales increased behind two percent volume growth, a one percent positive product mix impact from disproportionate growth in prestige fragrances and three points of favorable foreign exchange. Prestige Fragrances volume was up high-single digits behind growth on Dolce & Gabbana, Hugo Boss and Lacoste. In skin care, volume was up low-single digits as high-single digit growth in developing regions more than offset lower developed market volumes from the impact of a base period in North America that included the launch of Olay Definity. Olay market share in the US increased more than one point versus the year-ago period. Hair care volume was also up low-single digits as high-single digit growth in developing regions more than offset a low-single digit volume decline in developed regions due to the timing of promotion and initiative activity in North America. Hair care market share in the U.S. increased by nearly two points during the quarter. The SK-II brand continues to recover from prior period business disruptions in Asia and had a negative impact of roughly one percent on Beauty sales. Net earnings in Beauty increased nine percent to $689 million primarily behind higher sales growth. Before-tax profit margin was roughly in-line with the year-ago period as volume scale leverage and cost savings projects in manufacturing and overheads offset the impact of higher commodity costs and increased marketing investment. Grooming net sales increased nine percent to $2.0 billion during the quarter. Sales were up behind five percent volume growth, a positive one percent pricing impact and a four percent favorable foreign exchange impact. These were partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact as positive product mix from growth on the premium-priced Fusion brand was more than offset by disproportionate growth in developing regions, where average selling prices are below the segment average. Blades and razors volume increased high-single digits behind growth in developing regions exceeding 20%. In developed regions, blades and razors volume was down due to a base period that included significant pipeline shipments related to the Fusion launch in Western Europe and Japan. Fusion delivered double-digit volume growth in every geographic region where it has launched. Market share in the U.S. was up four points on Fusion and two points on Venus behind the Venus Breeze launch. Braun volume was down mid-single digits for the quarter primarily due to lower home appliances shipments resulting from shipment constraints in Western Europe and a de-emphasis of the home appliances business in the U.S. Net earnings in Grooming were up 17% for the quarter to $451 million behind sales growth and a 150-basis point earnings margin expansion. Earnings margin improved behind lower overhead spending from volume scale leverage and Gillette synergies, partially offset by higher marketing investment levels as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care net sales increased seven percent during the quarter to $3.6 billion behind a four percent increase in volume. Pricing added one percent and foreign exchange had a positive three percent impact on net sales. Disproportionate growth in developing regions on feminine care and oral care resulted in a negative one percent mix impact. Feminine care volume increased mid-single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions. Oral care volume was up low-single digits behind high-single digit growth in developing regions. Oral care volume in developed regions grew slightly over a base period that included the launch of Crest Pro Health paste in North America. Crest toothpaste market share in the U.S. increased more than one point versus the year-ago period behind continued growth on Pro Health. Volume in pharmaceuticals and personal health was in-line with the year-ago period as the impact of adding the Swiss Precision Diagnostics business was offset by lower bas business shipments on the remaining categories. Net earnings in Health Care were up nine percent to $648 million behind sales growth and gross margin improvement. Gross margin was up behind volume scale leverage, pricing and lower product costs. SG&A was roughly in-line with the year-ago period as higher marketing spending was offset by lower overheads as a Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased six percent to $1.1 billion during the quarter. Volume increased two percent while product mix from the launch of premium-priced coffee products and favorable foreign exchange each had a positive two percent impact. Snacks volume was up double-digits behind the launch of Rice Infusion in Western Europe. Coffee volume increased mid-single digits behind the launch of Folgers Black Silk, Folgers House Blend and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. In pet care, volume was down due to continued negative impacts from the voluntary wet pet food recall in the U.S. last fiscal year. Net earnings in Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care increased 30% to $113 million as a result of sales growth, an insurance recovery related to Hurricane Katrina and lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 10 percent to $5.9 billion. Volume was up eight percent and favorable foreign exchange added three percent to sales growth. This was partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact primarily from disproportionate growth in developing regions and on large pack sizes in fabric care. Fabric care volume increased high-single digits behind the initial wave of the liquid laundry detergent compaction launch in North America and the launch of Tide Pure Essentials. Home care volume was up double-digits for the quarter behind the Dawn restage in North America, the launch of Febreze candles and continued expansion of auto-dishwashing products in Western Europe. Batteries volume was up mid-single digits behind double-digit volume growth in developing regions. Net earnings in Fabric Care and Home Care increased 10 percent to $916 million. Earnings margin was in-line with the year-ago level as a slight reduction in gross margin was offset by an improvement SG&A. Gross margin was down slightly as volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings projects largely offset higher commodity costs. SG&A improved as a percentage of net sales as higher marketing spending was more than offset by lower overheads as a percentage of net sales. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 10 percent to $3.4 billion behind eight percent volume growth and a three percent favorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact from disproportionate growth on large pack sizes and on the lower-priced Basic product tier. Volume growth was balanced across the segment with high-single digit growth in both baby care and family care. Baby care volume in developed regions was up mid-single digits behind growth on Pampers Baby Stages of Development and on the Baby Dry caterpillar flex initiative. In developing regions, baby care volume was up double-digits, led by growth on Pampers across regions. Family care volume was up behind the Charmin product restage and continued growth on the Basic product tier. Net earnings in Baby Care and Family Care were up 12 percent to $430 million behind sales growth and a 50-basis point improvement in before-tax profit margin. Gross margin declined from the impact of higher pulp and commodity costs, but was more than offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales resulting from lower overhead and marketing as a percentage of Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, certain restructuring charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested brands and categories, including certain Gillette brands that were divested as required by the regulatory authorities in relation to the Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority Net earnings in Corporate increased $47 million versus the year-ago period. The increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned one-time tax benefit resulting from a change in the statutory tax rate in Germany, partially offset by higher restructuring spending. Cash generated from operating activities was $3.2 billion, an increase of nine percent versus the comparable prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation and deferred income taxes) provided $4.2 billion of operating cash. This was partially offset by an increase in working capital driven by higher inventory and accounts receivable levels. Investing activities in the current year used $419 million, compared to the prior year period cash use of $448 million. Capital expenditures were $540 million, or 2.7 percent of net sales for the quarter. Proceeds from asset sales generated $274 million in cash from the sale of our adult incontinence business in Japan and cash received during the current quarter for minor Beauty divestitures that closed last fiscal year. Total cash used by financing activities was $3.6 billion versus $2.5 billion in the comparable prior year period. We repurchased $2.6 billion of treasury shares under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. We reduced our debt position by $385 million during the quarter. In the prior year period, we repurchased $1.4 billion of treasury shares funded in part by increases in our debt position of $550 million during the period. As of September 30, 2007 the Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.7 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long- and short-term debt ratings which will enable it to continue to refinance this debt at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions that, if needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth . Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the July-September quarter: Less: Foreign Exchange Impact Less: Acquisition/Divestiture Impact Free Cash Flow . Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk Free Cash Flow Productivity . Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Item 3.

Lafley and Daley, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. In August 2007, The Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company, a subsidiary of the Company, received and subsequently accepted an offer of settlement from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District to resolve notices of violation alleging noncompliance with certain air emission permit requirements at the subsidiary’s Sacramento, California plant.

Such changes are discussed below in “Fiscal Year 2008 Changes to Global Business Unit (GBU) Structure.” This Form 8-K provides revised (1) Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and (2) Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes that reflect the impact of this new reporting structure. The change in the reporting structure, as reflected in the information included in this Form 8-K, only affects the manner in which segment results were previously reported. It in no way revises or restates the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for any period. The only changes to the information disclosed in the Company’s original Form 10-K filing are to the segment discussion within the MD&A and to Footnotes 2, 3 and 12, as these were the only sections impacted by the change in the Company’s segment reporting structure. Fiscal Year 2008 Changes to Global Business Unit (GBU) Structure In May 2007, the Company announced a number of changes to our organization structure and certain of our key leadership positions that became effective on July 1, 2007. These resulted in changes to our GBU and segment structure. Specifically, our new structure is comprised of three GBUs with a total of six reportable segments: Global Business Unit (GBU) • Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care • Fabric Care and Home Care • Baby Care and Family Care Prior to July 1, 2007, the Company consisted of three Global Business Units: Beauty and Health; Household Care; and Gillette GBU. The businesses that previously comprised the Gillette GBU are now included within the Beauty and Household Care GBUs. As a result of these moves, the Duracell and Braun business no longer comprise a separate reportable segment. The Braun business has been combined and is being managed with the Blades and Razors business to form the Grooming reportable segment within the Beauty GBU. The Grooming reportable segment also includes all face and shave prep products, which were previously reported within the Beauty reportable segment. The Duracell business has been moved to our Household Care GBU and is now be reported as part of our Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. Finally, our feminine care business, which previously was part of our Beauty GBU and reportable segment, is now being managed within our Health and Well-Being GBU and is now reported as part of the Health Care reportable segment. These changes were effective as of July 1, 2007. All financial statements, beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2007, reflect the new segment reporting structure. This change in segment reporting was reflected on a retrospective basis, with prior years also revised to reflect the new segment reporting structure.

We also refer to financial defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP) , including organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership stores and drug stores. We have also expanded our presence in ""high frequency stores,"" the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in over 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Northeast Asia) and developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India). following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended December 31, 2007 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the six months ended December 31, 2007 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, sales grew eight percent to $41.8 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, volume increased five percent and organic volume grew six percent. Every reportable segment and geographic region posted year-on-year organic volume growth. earnings increased 14 percent to $6.3 billion. Net earnings increased behind sales growth, higher operating profit, a lower and favorable foreign exchange. net earnings per share were $1.90, an increase of 17 percent versus comparable prior year period. cash flow was $7.4 billion, an increase of 36 percent versus the year period. Free cash flow productivity was 97 percent for the fiscal year to date period. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements,"" and are based financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component which can be affected by acquisitions and divestitures, we must manage and integrate key company transactions, such Gillette and Wella acquisitions, including achieving the cost and growth synergies for those transactions in accordance with stated goals, and the successful separation of the Company’s coffee business while continuing to deliver the Company’s goals. Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Conditions. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent and intellectual property matters, as well as those related to the integration of Gillette and its subsidiaries) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may Three Months Ended December 31, 2007 following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2007 versus the three months ended December 31, 2006.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, certain restructuring charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested brands and categories, including certain Gillette brands that were divested as required by the regulatory authorities in relation to the Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar earnings in Corporate increased $117 million for the quarter primarily due the gain on the sale of our Western European family care business and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Fiscal year to date, net earnings in Corporate increased $166 million versus the year-ago period. The increase was driven primarily by higher divestiture gains and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. Divestiture gains in the current year period include our Western European family care business and our adult incontinence business Japan. Our fiscal year to date tax rate was down 260-basis points due to a one-time tax benefit in the first quarter resulting from a change in statutory tax rate in Germany, tax audit settlements and a more favorable generated from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period was billion, an increase of 36 percent versus the comparable prior year period. Operating cash increased due to higher net earnings and an improvement in working capital days versus the base period. Accounts receivable days improved by two days versus the prior year level due to Gillette integration benefits including a temporary increase in the base period due Gillette integration impacts. Inventory days increased one day and accounts payable days were down one day. activities in the current year used $915 million, compared to the prior year period cash use of $623 million.

Proceeds from asset sales generated $747 million in cash primarily from the sale of our Western European family care business and our adult incontinence business in Japan. cash used by financing activities was $6.7 billion this fiscal year to date, versus $6.6 billion in the comparable prior year period. We repurchased $5.5 billion of treasury shares under a previously announced buyback program that started in July 2007. We reduced our debt position by $72 million during the fiscal year. In the prior year period, we repurchased $2.7 billion of treasury shares and reduced our debt position by $2.6 billion. December 31, 2007 the Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.5 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long- and short-term debt ratings which will enable it to continue to refinance this at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions that, if needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to short-term financing requirements. discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the Growth . Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing growth on a consistent basis. reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the October Acquisition/Divestiture Impact reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal Acquisition/Divestiture Impact Flow . Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Productivity . Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions):",5565

The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month period ended March 31, 2008 are not necessarily indicative Comprehensive Income — Total comprehensive income is composed primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges and net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. Total comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 was $4,389 million and $2,800 million, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, total comprehensive income was $12,588 million and $8,976 million, respectively. Segment Information — Following is a summary of segment results. In May 2007, we announced a number of changes to our organization structure and certain of our key leadership positions. The changes became effective on July 1, 2007 and resulted in changes to our GBU and reporting segment structure. The businesses that previously comprised the Gillette GBU are now included within the Beauty and Household Care GBUs. The Braun business has been combined with the Blades and Razors business to form the Grooming reportable segment within the Beauty GBU. The Grooming reportable segment also includes all face and shave prep products which were previously reported within the Beauty reportable segment. Duracell was moved to our Household Care GBU and will be reported as part of our Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. Finally, our feminine care business, which previously was part of our Beauty GBU and reportable segment, is now part of our Health and Well-Being GBU and will be reported as part of the Health Care reportable segment. The following segment information reflects the new segment reporting structure. Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The Company acquired the Gillette Company in October 2005. At that time, we recognized an assumed liability for Gillette exit costs of $1.23 billion, including $854 million in separations related to approximately 5,500 people, $55 million in employee relocation costs and $320 million in other exit costs. These costs are primarily related to the elimination of selling, general and administrative overlap between the two companies in areas like Global Business Services, corporate staff and go-to-market support, as well as redundant manufacturing capacity. As of March 31, 2008, the remaining liability was $322 million. Total integration plan charges against the assumed liability were $94 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and $243 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008. A total of $109 million of the liability was reversed to goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2008 related to underspending on a number of projects that were concluded during the period. We expect such activities to be substantially complete by June 30, 2008. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — Goodwill as of March 31, 2008 is allocated by reportable segment and global business unit as follows (amounts in millions): Beauty, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Grooming, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Health Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Fabric Care and Home Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Baby Care and Family Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures GOODWILL, Net, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures The increase in goodwill from June 30, 2007 is primarily due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets as of March 31, 2008 are comprised of (amounts in Amortizable intangible assets with Intangible assets with indefinite lives Total identifiable intangible assets Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 was $156 million and $153 million, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, the amortization expense of intangible assets was $468 million and $484 million respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment”, companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the “fair-value-based” method). Total share-based compensation for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): SFAS 123(R) Stock Options Total Share-Based Compensation Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. Postretirement Benefits — The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) For the year ending June 30, 2008, the expected return on plan assets is 7.4% and 9.3% for defined benefit and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. On July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 addresses the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The difference between the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a position in accordance with FIN 48 and the tax benefit claimed in the tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a decrease to retained earnings as of July 1, 2007 of $232 million, which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, with a corresponding increase to the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The impact primarily reflects the accrual of additional statutory interest and penalties as required by FIN 48, partially offset by adjustments to existing unrecognized tax benefits to comply with FIN 48 measurement principles. The implementation of FIN 48 also resulted in a reduction in our net tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions accounted for under purchase accounting, resulting in an $80 million decrease to goodwill. Additionally, the Company historically classified unrecognized tax benefits in current taxes payable. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, unrecognized tax benefits not expected to be paid in the next 12 months were reclassified to other non-current liabilities. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at July 1, 2007 was $2,971 million, excluding any related accruals for interest and penalties. Included in this total was $1,893 million that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties as of July 1, 2007 were $589 million and $128 million, respectively, on an after tax basis. P&G is present in over 140 taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time, has 30-40 audits underway at various stages of completion. We have tax years open ranging from 1997 and forward. P&G has made a concerted effort to bring its audit inventory to a more current position. We have done this by working with tax authorities to conduct audits for several open years at once. While we may be able to estimate the timing of the resolution we are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available we anticipate that over the next 12 month period net audit activity could favorably impact earnings by a range of up to $150 million to $250 million. On an ongoing basis, adjustments will be made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits to reflect the impact of audit developments, tax law changes, statute expirations, as well as for the accrual of additional current year tax exposures and for interest and penalties on existing The unrecognized tax benefits described above will be included in the Company’s annual Form 10-K contractual obligations table to the extent the Company is able to make reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. If not, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will be disclosed in a footnote to the contractual obligations table. At this time, the Company can not make a reliable estimate as to the timing of cash settlements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) and SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 revise the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations and non-controlling interests, including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price), the impacts of partial and step-acquisitions (including the valuation of net assets attributable to non-acquired minority interests), and post acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will be effective for the company during our fiscal year beginning In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 161 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations — Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 Results of Operations — Nine months Ended March 31, 2008 Business Segment Discussion — Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2008 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of market share information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We have also expanded our presence in “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in over 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Northeast Asia) and four developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India). The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2008 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2008: Net sales grew nine percent to $62.2 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased five percent. Unit volume increased five percent and organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, grew six percent. Every reportable segment posted year-on-year volume growth and each geographic region delivered year-on-year organic volume growth. Net earnings increased 12 percent to $9.1 billion. Net earnings increased behind higher operating profit, a lower tax rate and favorable foreign exchange. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.72, an increase of 15 percent versus the comparable prior year period. Operating cash flow was $11.7 billion, an increase of 19 percent versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity was 109 percent for the fiscal year to date period. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component which can be affected by acquisitions and divestitures, we must manage and integrate key company transactions, such as the Gillette and Wella acquisitions, including achieving the cost and growth synergies for those transactions in accordance with stated goals, and the successful separation of the Company’s coffee business while continuing to deliver the Company’s goals. Cost Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Global Economic Conditions. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent and intellectual property matters, as well as those related to the integration of Gillette and its subsidiaries) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2008 versus the three months ended March 31, 2007. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Net sales increased nine percent for the quarter to $20.5 billion. Volume was up four percent, including a negative one percent impact from the divestiture of our Western European family care business. Price increases, taken primarily to offset higher commodity costs, contributed one percent to net sales growth. These were partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact resulting from disproportionate double-digit volume growth in developing regions, where average selling price is below the company average. Favorable foreign exchange added five percent to net sales. Every reportable segment, except Beauty, posted mid-single digit or higher organic volume growth. Volume grew primarily behind initiative activity on our key brands and continued developing region expansion. The Company delivered high-single digit or higher volume growth on Always, Ariel, Dolce & Gabbana, Febreze, Fusion, Gain, Head & Shoulders, Naturella, Pampers, Pringles, Rejoice, Venus and Vicks for the quarter, partially offset by declines on Braun, Folgers and Mach3. Organic volume and sales were both up five percent for the quarter. Net Sales Change Drivers 2008 vs. 2007 (Three Months Ended Mar. 31) Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are Gross margin was down 30-basis points for the quarter to 51.3% of net sales. Commodity and energy cost increases had a negative impact on gross margin of over 220-basis points. These were largely offset by scale leverage from volume growth, pricing and cost savings projects resulting from manufacturing efficiency improvements and product reformulations. The year over year gross margin change was also impacted by a number of base period charges, including net charges related to the integration of Gillette, supply chain restructuring projects and the impacts of the pet food recall, that reduced the base period gross margin approximately 50-basis points. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased six percent to $6.4 billion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down 80-basis points as a result of lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. Total overhead spending increased, but was down as a percentage of net sales for the total Company and in each reportable segment primarily due to scale leverage, a focus on overhead productivity and Gillette synergy savings. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was in-line with the prior year period. Interest expense for the quarter was up $85 million versus the year-ago period due to a higher debt level and a higher interest rate driven by the geographic mix of our short-term borrowings. Other non-operating income decreased $159 million versus the prior year period primarily due to lower current period interest income and base period gains on the sale of minor beauty and feminine care brands. Interest income declined primarily due to lower interest rates. Net earnings increased eight percent for the quarter to $2.7 billion behind a 13 percent increase in operating profit and a lower tax rate, partially offset by lower other non-operating income. Our effective tax rate was down 110-basis points primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings. There is a possibility of favorable tax audit activity in the April - June quarter that could impact the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year effective tax rate. However, given the uncertainty around such items, we cannot quantify the potential impact at this time. Diluted net earnings per share were up 11 percent to $0.82. Diluted net earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to share repurchase activity. We repurchased $2.6 billion of treasury shares during the quarter under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Nine months Ended March 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2007. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Net sales for the fiscal year to date period were up nine percent to $62.2 billion behind five percent volume growth and a favorable five percent foreign exchange impact. This was partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact primarily due to disproportionate double-digit growth in developing regions. Volume growth was broad-based across segments and geographic regions. Each reportable segment posted year-on-year volume growth and each geographic region delivered year-on-year organic volume growth for the fiscal year to date period. Volume grew primarily behind initiative activity on key brands and continued expansion in developing regions. A number of the company’s key brands, including Always, Ariel, Dolce & Gabbana, Downy, Febreze, Fusion, Gain, Head & Shoulders, Hugo Boss, Naturella, Pampers, Pringles, Oral-B, Tide and Venus, posted high-single digit or higher volume growth to offset declines on Actonel, Braun, Iams and Mach3. Organic sales increased five percent for the fiscal year to date period behind six percent organic Net Sales Change Drivers 2008 vs. 2007 (Nine months Ended Mar. 31) Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are Gross margin was down 40-basis points fiscal year to date to 52.0% of net sales. Commodity and energy cost increases had a negative impact on gross margin of over 150-basis points. These were largely offset by scale leverage from volume growth and cost savings projects resulting from manufacturing efficiency improvements and product reformulations. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased six percent to $19.1 billion for the fiscal year to date period. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down 70-basis points primarily behind lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Total overhead spending increased, but was down as a percentage of net sales for the total Company and for each reportable segment primarily due to scale leverage, a focus on overhead productivity and Gillette synergy savings. Interest expense for the fiscal year to date period was up $136 million versus the year-ago period due to a higher interest rate driven by the geographic mix of our short-term borrowings. Other non-operating income was down $34 million primarily due to lower interest income, which more than offset higher current period divestiture gains. Current year gains included a gain on the sale of our Western Europe family care business and our Japanese adult incontinence business. The base period included gains on the sale of Pert in North America, Sure and minor beauty and feminine Net earnings increased 12 percent to $9.1 billion behind higher operating profit, a lower tax rate and favorable foreign exchange. Our tax rate declined from 29.8% to 27.7% due to a one-time tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the German statutory tax rate, which reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets, the favorable settlement of tax audits and a more favorable geographic mix of earnings. Diluted net earnings per share were up 15 percent versus the prior year to $2.72 per share. Diluted net earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to share repurchase activity. We repurchased $8.0 billion of treasury shares during the fiscal year to date period under a previously announced share buyback program that BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION— Three and Nine months Ended March 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008 are provided compared to the same three and nine month period ended March 31, 2007. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008 versus the comparable prior year period (Amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Nine months Ended March 31, 2008 Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Beauty net sales increased nine percent for the quarter to $4.7 billion. Net sales were up on three percent volume growth and a six percent favorable foreign exchange impact. Volume was up mid-single digits in both hair color, behind the Nice ‘N Easy Perfect 10 launch, and in cosmetics, behind the Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara initiative. Retail hair care volume was also up mid-single digits as high-teens growth on Head & Shoulders, double-digit growth on Rejoice and high-single digit growth on Pantene outside of North America more than offset an 11 percent decline on Pantene in North America. Prestige fragrances volume was up low-single digits and organic volume was up mid-single digits as a result of new product launches on Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana. Skin care volume was flat versus a base period that grew double-digits behind initiative pipeline volume builds in developing regions and mid-teens growth in North America. Professional hair care volume was in-line with the prior year period as mid-single digit growth in developing regions was offset by a low-single digit decline in developed regions. Volume in deodorants was due to a double-digit decline in Western Europe resulting primarily from market softness. Net earnings in Beauty declined two percent to $589 million. Net earnings margin was down 140-basis points as lower gross margin and the impact of base period minor brand divestiture gains more than offset lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined due to higher commodity costs, which more than offset benefits from volume scale leverage and cost savings projects. SG&A improved as a percentage of net sales as lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales more than offset increased marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Beauty net sales increased eight percent fiscal year to date to $14.5 billion. Net sales increased behind three percent volume growth and five points of favorable foreign exchange. Product mix was neutral as the favorable impacts of disproportionate growth in prestige fragrances and the launch of premium-priced clinical strength deodorants were offset by the impact of disproportionate growth in developing regions, where selling prices are below the segment average. Skin care volume was up mid-single digits driven by growth on Olay behind the Definity and Regenerist initiatives. Prestige fragrances volume was up mid-single digits and organic volume was up high-single digits behind new product launches on Dolce & Gabbana and Hugo Boss. Retail hair care volume was up mid-single digits, led by high-single digit growth in developing markets. Retail hair care volume in developed regions was flat as a 20% volume increase on Head & Shoulders was offset by a double-digit volume decline on Pantene in North America. Hair color volume increased low-single digits as growth on Nice ‘N Easy behind the Perfect 10 launch more than offset declines on minor color brands. Volume in deodorants was down mid-single digits primarily due to competitive activity and market softness in Western Europe. Net earnings in Beauty increased six percent to $2.2 billion. Net earnings margin was down 40-basis points as lower gross margin and base period divestiture gains on minor brands more than offset improved SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was down due to higher commodity costs, which more than offset volume scale leverage and cost savings projects. SG&A improved behind lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, which more than offset higher marketing spending as a Grooming net sales increased 13 percent for the quarter to $2.0 billion behind six percent volume growth and a seven percent favorable foreign exchange impact. Price increases taken across premium shaving systems added two percent to net sales. Product mix had a negative two percent mix impact on net sales as the positive mix impact from growth on the premium-priced Fusion brand was more than offset by disproportionate growth in developing regions, where selling prices are below the segment average. Blades and razors volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit volume growth in developing regions on the expansion of Fusion and the launch of Venus Embrace in North America. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single digit volume decline in Western Europe, due primarily to base period pipeline volume related to the Fusion launch in several Western European markets, and lower Mach3 shipments resulting from the business’ trade-up strategy to the Fusion line. Braun volume was down mid-single digits globally. High-single digit volume growth in developing regions was more than offset by overall softness in Western Europe, lower volume in home appliances resulting primarily from supply constraints at our contract manufacturer and the previously announced exit of the U.S. home appliance business. Net earnings in Grooming were up 30 percent for the quarter to $403 million behind higher net sales and a 270-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin was up primarily behind lower overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was up slightly as benefits of volume scale leverage, pricing and a more profitable product mix were largely offset by higher costs incurred at our contract manufacturer on the Braun home appliance business. Grooming net sales increased 11 percent to $6.2 billion fiscal year to date. Net sales were up behind six percent volume growth, a seven percent favorable foreign exchange impact and a one percent positive pricing impact. Product mix had a negative three percent impact on net sales as positive product mix from growth on the premium-priced Fusion brand was more than offset by the impact of disproportionate growth in developing regions. Blades and razors volume increased high-single digits behind volume growth of over 20% in developing regions driven primarily by Fusion expansion. In developed regions, blades and razors volume was down low-single digits due to a base period that included significant pipeline shipments related to the Fusion launch in Western Europe and Japan and lower current period Mach3 shipments resulting from the business’ trade-up strategy to the Fusion line. Braun volume was down mid-single digits fiscal year to date primarily due to lower home appliance shipments resulting from supply constraints at our contract manufacturer, the previously announced exit of the home appliance business in the U.S. and the divestiture of thermometer and blood pressure devices. Net earnings in Grooming were up 19% fiscal year to date to $1.3 billion behind net sales growth and a 150-basis point earnings margin expansion. Earnings margin improved behind lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin declined due to higher costs incurred at our contract manufacturer on the Braun home appliance business, which more than offset higher pricing, benefits from volume scale leverage and a more profitable product mix. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down due to lower overhead spending, partially offset by higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care net sales were up 11 percent for the quarter to $3.7 billion. Net sales growth was driven by a six percent increase in volume and a six percent favorable foreign exchange impact. Disproportionate growth in feminine care in developing regions, where selling prices are below the segment average, drove a negative one percent mix impact. Feminine care volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit growth on Naturella and high-single digit growth on Always, partially offset by a low-single digit decline on Tampax. Oral care volume increased mid-single digits with both Crest and Oral-B posting mid-single digit growth. Volume in pharmaceuticals and personal health was up mid-single digits as the addition of the Swiss Precision Diagnostics joint venture and high-single digit growth on Vicks, driven by high cold and flu incidence in North America during the quarter, more than offset low-single digit volume growth in pharmaceuticals and on Prilosec OTC. Prilosec OTC volume is expected to decline significantly starting in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the recent loss of marketplace exclusivity and the entry of competing products into the market. This is expected to have an adverse effect on the results of the Health Care segment in future periods. Net earnings in Health Care were up 15 percent to $617 million. Net earnings margin was up 60-basis points primarily due to lower overhead expenses as a percent of net sales, which more than offset lower gross margin. Gross margin was down due to higher commodity costs and a less profitable product mix, primarily from disproportionate growth in developing regions in feminine care and oral care (which have lower gross margin than the segment Health Care net sales increased nine percent fiscal year to date to $11.0 billion behind a five percent increase in volume. Foreign exchange had a positive five percent impact on net sales. Disproportionate growth in developing regions on feminine care and oral care resulted in a negative one percent mix impact. Feminine care volume increased mid-single digits and organic volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit growth on Naturella and high-single digit growth on Always, which more than offset a low-single digit decline on Tampax. Oral care volume was up mid-single digits behind initiative-driven growth on Oral-B toothbrushes and Crest. Volume in pharmaceuticals and personal health was up low-single digits as the impact of adding the Swiss Precision Diagnostics business and mid-single digit growth on Prilosec OTC was largely offset by lower shipments on Actonel. Prilosec OTC volume is expected to decline significantly starting in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the recent loss of marketplace exclusivity and the entry of competing products into the market. This is expected to have an adverse effect on the results of the Health Care segment in future periods. Net earnings in Health Care were up 11 percent to $2.0 billion behind net sales growth and a 30-basis point improvement in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased as reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales more than offset lower gross margin. Gross margin was down as higher commodity costs and a less profitable mix primarily from disproportionate growth in developing regions in feminine care and oral care more than offset volume scale leverage. SG&A improved primarily behind lower overhead spending as a Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased 11 percent for the quarter to $1.2 billion on four percent volume growth. Increased pricing in coffee and pet care added five percent to net sales. Favorable foreign exchange added three percent, partially offset by a negative one percent product mix impact from disproportionate growth in Snacks. Snacks volume increased double-digits driven by the Pringles Rice Infusion and Pringles Extreme Flavors initiatives. Coffee volume was up low-single digits behind the Dunkin’ Donuts ® license agreement, which was not in the prior year period. Pet care volume was down low-single digits due to continued negative impacts from the voluntary wet pet food recall in the U.S. in March 2007. Net earnings in Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care were $105 million, down nine percent due to the receipt in the base period of a Hurricane Katrina insurance payment. Net earnings margin was down 200-basis points due to lower gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was down as higher commodity costs more than offset higher pricing and base period impacts related to the pet care recall. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased significantly, despite lower current period overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, due to the Hurricane Katrina insurance receipt in Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased seven percent to $3.6 billion fiscal year to date. Net sales grew behind a two percent volume increase, a positive two percent price impact resulting from price increases in coffee and pet care and a three percent favorable foreign exchange impact. Snacks volume was up high-single digits behind the launch of Rice Infusion in Western Europe, Extreme Flavors in North America and continued growth on Pringles Minis and Selects. Coffee volume increased low-single digits primarily behind the Dunkin’ Donuts ® license agreement. In pet care, volume was down mid-single digits due to continued negative impacts from the voluntary wet pet food recall in the U.S. in March 2007. Net earnings in Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care were down two percent to $345 million. Net earnings margin was down 90-basis points as lower gross margin was partially offset by improved SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was down as higher commodity costs more than offset price increases and base period pet recall impacts. SG&A decreased as a percentage of net sales due to lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Hurricane Katrina insurance payments were received in both the current and the base period and, therefore, had minimal impact on the segment’s year-on-year net In January 2008, P&G announced plans to separate its coffee business and create an independent company. The coffee business had net sales of approximately $1.6 billion and operating income of about $350 million in fiscal 2007. Although no decision has been made on the form of the separation, P&G expects to do a spin-off or split-off transaction in the first half of fiscal 2009. Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 10 percent to $5.8 billion for the quarter on six percent volume growth. Favorable foreign exchange added five percent to net sales, but was partially offset by a negative one percent mix impact resulting from disproportionate growth in developing regions and on large pack sizes in fabric care, both of which have selling prices below the segment average. Fabric care volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit developing region growth and initiative activity on Ariel, Downy, Gain and Tide, including continued growth behind the liquid laundry detergent compaction expansion in North America. Home care volume was up mid-single digits behind growth on Febreze Candles, the expansion of Fairy auto-dishwashing in Western Europe and high-single digit growth on Cascade resulting from high levels of customer orders in advance of a March price increase. Batteries volume was up mid-single digits as high-single digit growth in developing regions more than offset a mid-single digit decline in North America resulting from market softness. Net earnings in Fabric Care and Home Care increased 12 percent to $781 million. Net earnings margin was up 20-basis points behind a lower tax rate resulting from disproportionate growth in developing regions, where tax rates are below the segment average. Lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales offset lower gross margin. Gross margin was down due to higher commodity costs, which more than offset the benefits of volume scale leverage and cost savings projects. SG&A as percentage of net sales improved due to lower overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales. Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 10 percent to $17.7 billion fiscal year to date. Volume was up seven percent and favorable foreign exchange added five percent to net sales growth. This was partially offset by a negative two percent mix impact primarily from disproportionate double-digit growth in developing regions and on large pack sizes in fabric care. Fabric care volume increased high-single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions, the liquid laundry detergent compaction launch in North America and initiative activity on Tide, Gain, Ariel and Downy. Home care volume was up mid-single digits behind the Dawn restage in North America, the launch of Febreze Candles and continued expansion of auto-dishwashing products in Western Europe. Batteries volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions and mid-single digit growth in North America. Net earnings in Fabric Care and Home Care increased nine percent to $2.6 billion. Earnings margin was down 20-basis points primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was down due to higher commodity costs, which more than offset benefits from volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings projects. SG&A improved as a percentage of net sales as lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales more than offset higher marketing spending as a percentage of Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased eight percent to $3.5 billion for the quarter. Volume was up one percent, including the impact of the Western European Family Care divestiture in October 2007. Price increases in both Baby Care and Family Care and favorable product mix each contributed one percent to net sales and favorable foreign exchange added five percent. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of the Western European family care divestiture and foreign exchange, were up eight percent behind a seven percent increase in organic volume. Baby care volume was up high-single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions on Pampers and continued growth on Baby Dry and Swaddlers in developed regions. Family care volume was down mid-single digits due to the divestiture of the Western European family care business but was up high-single digits on an organic basis behind growth on both Charmin and Bounty. Net earnings in Baby Care and Family Care were up 23 percent to $471 million. Net earnings margin was up 170-basis point behind higher gross margin and improved SG&A costs. Gross margin was up behind a more profitable product mix following the Western Europe family care divestiture, volume scale leverage, increased pricing and cost savings projects, which more than offset higher commodity and energy costs. SG&A improved as a percentage of net sales due to lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales and the receipt of payments for transitional services performed by P&G for the divested Western European family care business, partially offset by higher marketing spending as a percentage of net Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased nine percent fiscal year to date to $10.3 billion. Volume was up four percent, including the impact of the Western European family care divestiture. Foreign exchange had a positive five percent impact in net sales. Organic volume and organic sales, which exclude the impacts of the Western European family care divestiture and foreign exchange, both grew eight percent. Organic volume growth was balanced across the segment with high-single digit growth in both baby care and family care. Baby care volume in developed regions was up mid-single digits behind growth on Pampers Baby Stages of Development and on the Baby Dry caterpillar flex initiative. In developing regions, baby care volume was up double-digits behind continued growth on Pampers. Family care volume was down low-single digits due to the divestiture of the Western European family care business. Family care organic volume was up high-single digits behind the Bounty and Charmin product restages. Net earnings in Baby Care and Family Care were up 19 percent to $1.3 billion. Net earnings margin improved 110-basis points behind higher gross lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin was up as a more profitable product mix following the Western Europe family care divestiture, volume scale leverage and cost savings projects more than offset higher commodity and energy costs. SG&A improved as a percentage of net sales due to lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales and the receipt of payments for transitional services performed by P&G for the divested Western European family care business. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, financing and investing activities, certain restructuring charges, other general corporate items and the historical results of certain divested brands and categories, including certain Gillette brands that were divested as required by the regulatory authorities in relation to the Gillette acquisition. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority Net earnings in Corporate decreased $121 million for the quarter primarily due to higher interest expense, lower interest income and base period divestiture gains. Fiscal year to date, net earnings in Corporate increased $43 million versus the year-ago period. The increase was driven primarily by a lower tax rate partially offset by higher interest expense. Our fiscal year to date tax rate was down 210-basis points primarily due to a one-time tax benefit in the first quarter resulting from a change in the statutory tax rate in Germany and the favorable settlement Cash generated from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period was $11.7 billion, an increase of 19 percent versus the comparable prior year period. Operating cash flow, and the increase in operating cash flow versus the prior year period, resulted primarily from increased net earnings and non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income tax expense). Working capital balances increased, resulting in a net use of cash, primarily to support business growth. Inventory days increased 10 days during the fiscal year to date period due to foreign exchange, softer than expected shipments in Beauty and higher inventory in fabric care to support the liquid laundry detergent compaction expansion in North America. Accounts payable days were down six days during the fiscal year to date period, but increased six days versus the comparable prior-year period largely due to foreign exchange. Accounts receivable days were down one day during the fiscal year to date period due to Gillette integration benefits, which more than offset foreign exchange impacts. Operating cash flow also benefitted from an income tax benefit associated with net investment hedges that matured or were terminated in the Investing activities in both the current and prior fiscal year to date periods used $1.2 billion in cash. Capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to date period were $1.9 billion, or 3.0 percent of net sales. Proceeds from asset sales in the current period generated $759 million in cash primarily from the sale of our Western European family care business and our adult incontinence business in Japan. Total cash used by financing activities was $12.5 billion this fiscal year to date, versus $11.5 billion in the comparable prior year period. We repurchased $8.0 billion of treasury shares under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. Net changes in the Company’s short and long-term debt balances due to borrowings, maturities and other payments used $2.5 billion of cash during the fiscal year, primarily due to the maturity and termination of instruments designated as net investment hedges. In the prior year period, we repurchased $4.1 billion of treasury shares and reduced our debt position by $5.6 billion. As of March 31, 2008 the Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.5 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. The Company anticipates being able to support its short-term liquidity through cash generated from operations. The Company also has very strong long- and short-term debt ratings which will enable it to continue to refinance this debt at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, the Company has agreements with a diverse group of creditworthy financial institutions that, if needed, would provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth . Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported net sales growth to organic sales for the January — March quarter: Less: Foreign Exchange Impact Less: Acquisition/Divestiture Impact The reconciliation of reported net sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date Less: Foreign Exchange Impact Less: Acquisition/Divestiture Impact Free Cash Flow . Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk Free Cash Flow Productivity . Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Item 3.

Fair Value Measurements On July 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157) for certain financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The statement requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories. Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. Fair Value Hierarchy Under the SFAS 157 hierarchy, an entity is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2008 that are measured on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Investment securities (1) Total assets at fair value Liabilities at fair value: Total Liabilities at fair value Investment securities consist primarily of non-qualified retirement plan assets. These securities are generally valued using observable market prices in active markets, with some securities valued using unobservable market prices in inactive markets. These investment securities are included within Other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for each period presented. Derivatives consist of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity derivative instruments. Foreign currency derivatives consist primarily of forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months and currency swaps with maturities up to 5 years. The Company can use such instruments to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted sales, inventory purchases, intercompany royalties, intercompany and external loans and its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally valued using observable forward rates in commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swaps. Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These interest rate derivatives are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps. Commodity derivatives consist of futures, swaps and options with maturities up to 5 years. We use these derivatives to manage a portion of the volatility in the cost of raw materials utilized in our products or production processes resulting from weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. These market instruments generally are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. They are generally measured using quoted commodity exchange prices in active markets and quoted commodity exchange prices for identical commodities. A small portion of these instruments are also valued using unobservable market prices in inactive markets. There were no gains, losses or settlements of Level 3 investment securities for the three months ended September 30, 2008. For Level 3 derivative securities we had $3 million of gains recorded in other non-operating income, net, $14 million of losses recorded in OCI and total settlements of $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008. No transfers in and/or out of Level 3 occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Based on this guidance, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as they relate to long-lived assets effective July 1, 2009, which it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) and SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 revise the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations and non-controlling interests, including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price), the impacts of partial and step-acquisitions (including the valuation of net assets attributable to non-acquired minority interests), and post acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will be effective for the company during our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 161 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation As previously disclosed, the Company recently became subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in the European Union, including investigations initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 by the European Commission with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries. We believe these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no significant formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. In response to the actions of the Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, which are ongoing. The Company has identified some violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. As these matters evolve the Company will, if necessary, recognize the appropriate reserves. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears on pages 73-74 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Form 10-K/A Amendment No. 1 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which was filed on October 3, 2008. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We have also expanded our presence in “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Japan) and four developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India/Korea). The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2008 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2008: Net sales grew 9% to $22.0 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 5%. Unit volume increased 2% and organic volume increased 3% led by growth in the Beauty segment. Net earnings increased 9% to $3.3 billion. Net earnings increased due to sales growth and higher divestiture gains partially offset by lower operating margin. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.03, an increase of 12% versus the comparable prior year period. Operating cash flow was $3.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity was 76% for the quarter. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. The following details a number of circumstances which could impact our ability to successfully achieve our business objectives. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected herein, please refer to Part II, Item 1A of this for 10-Q and our recent 10-K and 8-K reports. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must manage and integrate key acquisitions including achieving the cost and growth synergies in accordance with stated goals. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, significant credit or liquidity issues, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to a global or regional credit crisis or terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competition and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property and competition law matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2008 versus the three months ended September 30, 2007. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended September 30 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES Net sales for the quarter were up 9% to $22.0 billion. Sales growth was led by double-digit growth in the Beauty, the Fabric Care and Home Care and the Family Care and Baby Care segments. Unit volume increased 2% for the quarter led by mid-single digit growth in Beauty and in developing regions. Volume in developed regions declined low-single digits but grew low-single digits on an organic basis due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Volume growth was led by Head & Shoulders, Gain, Gillette Fusion, Cover Girl, Rejoice and SK-II, all of which posted double-digit volume growth to offset double-digit declines in Braun, Eukanuba, Febreze, Hugo Boss and Prilosec OTC. Foreign exchange had a positive 5% impact on sales growth. Price increases implemented to offset commodity-driven cost increases contributed 3% to net sales. These were partially offset by a negative 1% mix impact due to disproportionate growth in developing regions and a shift toward mid-tier brands, where average unit selling prices are below the Company average. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 5% for the quarter. Net Sales Change Drivers 2008 vs. 2007 (Three Months Ended Sept. 30) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin was down 240 basis points for the quarter to 50.5% of net sales. Commodity-driven cost impacts reduced gross margin by approximately 400 basis points. This was partially offset by the impact of price increases and manufacturing cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 3% to $6.4 billion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down 180 basis points. Both overhead and marketing spending were down as a percentage of net sales primarily due to scale leverage, overhead productivity improvements, marketing spending efficiencies and the impact of foreign currency transaction gains on working capital balances caused by strengthening of the U.S. dollar late in the quarter. Interest expense declined 6% for the quarter to $339 million driven mainly by a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income increased $144 million to $337 million primarily due to divestiture gains. The base period included a gain on the sale of our adult incontinence business in Japan, while the current period included gains on the sale of ThermaCare, Dantrium and Dryel. Net earnings increased 9% to $3.3 billion as sales growth, increased divestiture gains and favorable foreign exchange were partially offset by a lower operating margin resulting from a commodity-driven decline in gross margin. Our tax rate was up from 27.6% to 28.5% primarily due to the impact of a reduction in the German statutory tax rate in the year-ago period. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.03, up 12% versus the prior year. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of our share repurchase program. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION– Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2008 are provided compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2007. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2008 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Earnings Before Income Taxes Health and Well-Being GBU Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY GBU Beauty Beauty net sales increased 12% during the quarter to $5.1 billion. Net sales were up due to a 4% increase in volume, a 2% pricing impact and a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. Hair Care volume grew mid-single digits behind growth in developing regions. Globally, all major hair care brands contributed to volume growth led by mid-single digit growth of Pantene and double-digit growth of Head & Shoulders and Rejoice. This was partially offset by a low-single digit volume decline in Professional Hair Care. Cosmetics volume grew double digits behind continued growth of Cover Girl. Skin Care volume grew low-single digits due to double-digit growth of SK-II following a base period that was impacted by business disruptions in Asia. Global market share of facial skin care declined slightly on a decline in U.S. market share promotional activity by competitors. Prestige Fragrances volume declined low-single digits as double-digit increases of Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci were more than offset by lower shipments of Lacoste and Hugo Boss. Initiative launches in Prestige Fragrances are skewed toward the second half of fiscal 2009 and will continue to impact year-on-year results through the second quarter. Earnings grew 9% during the quarter to $754 million as higher net sales and lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by reduced gross margin from higher commodity costs. Grooming Grooming net sales were up 6% to $2.1 billion for the quarter. Volume declined 1% due to a double-digit decline of Braun. Blades & Razors volume grew low-single digits behind growth in developing regions. Double-digit growth of Gillette Fusion and high-single digit growth of Venus were mostly offset by declines in legacy shaving systems. Volume of Blades & Razors declined mid-single digits in developed regions primarily due to trade inventory reductions in North America and market softness in Western Europe. Global market share of the blades and razors category increased slightly for the quarter. Braun volume was down due to a double-digit decline of male hair removers, the exits of the U.S. home appliance and Tassimo coffee appliance businesses and the continued impact of supply constraints in Western Europe. Global market share of the dry shaving category increased 1 point for the quarter due to a 4 point increase in share of leg epilators. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 6% to net sales growth. Price increases taken across premium shaving systems added 3% to net sales. Product mix had a negative 2% impact on net sales as favorable product mix from growth on Gillette Fusion was more than offset by disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Net earnings increased 6% to $478 million for the quarter on sales growth. Net earnings margin declined slightly as lower gross margin was largely offset by lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales were up 4% during the quarter to $3.7 billion. Sales growth was driven by 5% favorable foreign exchange and a 2% increase in pricing. This was partially offset by a negative 3% product mix impact driven primarily by lower volume on Prilosec OTC and growth in developing regions. Segment volume was flat for the quarter including a negative 1% impact from divestitures. High-single digit growth in developing regions was offset by a mid-single digit decline in developed regions. Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits primarily behind double-digit growth of Crest in developing regions. Globally, Crest grew mid-single digits. Feminine Care volume was up low-single digits as high-single digit growth of Always in developing regions was partially offset by a high-single digit decline of Tampax globally and the divestiture of the Adult Incontinence business in Japan. Pharmaceuticals and Personal Health volume declined high-single digits due to a double-digit decline of Prilosec OTC from the loss of marketplace exclusivity and the divestitures of ThermaCare, Eneas and Dantrium. U.S. market share of the personal health category declined nearly 4 points for the quarter. Net earnings increased 2% for the quarter to $658 million as sales growth was partially offset by reduced operating margin. Reduced gross margin from higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix were partially offset by lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care net sales increased 9% to $1.2 billion for the quarter on a 2% volume increase. Snacks volume increased mid-single digits due to double-digit growth in North America behind base business growth of Pringles and continued growth from Pringles Extreme Flavors and Stix initiatives. Coffee volume grew low-single digits behind the Folgers Roast & Ground restage and continued expansion of the Dunkin Donuts ® line. Pet Care volume declined low-single digits as initiative driven growth of Iams was more than offset by a double-digit decline of Eukanuba. Pricing contributed 7% to net sales due to multiple price increases in Coffee and Pet Care which helped grow sales double digits and high-single digits, respectively. Favorable foreign exchange added 2% to net sales. Product mix had a negative 2% impact on sales due to the disproportionate growth of Snacks, which has lower selling prices than the segment average. Net earnings increased 6% to $120 million for the quarter as sales growth was partially offset by lower operating margin. Lower corporate overhead allocations to Coffee in advance of separating from the Company and lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by higher commodity costs in the current period and Katrina insurance claim receipts in the base period. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 10% during the quarter to $6.5 billion. Volume grew 2% behind mid-single digit growth of Fabric Care from the launch of Tide and Downy Total Care, trade inventory increases prior to announced price increases in North America and innovation in developing regions. Market share of the global fabric care category was down slightly to about 32%. Volume in Home Care declined low-single digits due to Febreze Candles and Mr. Clean Wipes initiatives in the base period and a decrease in trade inventory following price increases on Dawn and Swiffer in North America. Volume in Batteries was flat. Global market share of general purpose batteries declined about 1 point in the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed 4% to net sales and price increases added 4% to sales growth. Net earnings decreased 9% to $831 million as sales growth and lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by lower gross margin from significantly higher commodity costs. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 10% during the quarter to $3.8 billion. Volume grew 1%, including a negative 6% impact from the Western European Tissue divestiture. Baby Care volume grew high-single digits due to growth of Pampers in developing regions and double-digit growth of Luvs partially offset by a mid-single digit decline of Pampers in North America. Global market share of the baby care category was up slightly to approximately 35%. Family Care volume declined mid-single digits due to the Western European Tissue divestiture. Organic volume for Family Care was up high-single digits behind growth of Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. Family Care U.S. market share was up over 1 point to about 33%. Favorable foreign exchange added 4% to net sales. Price increases contributed 5% to sales growth. Mix was flat as the negative impacts of disproportionate growth in developing regions and growth of mid-tier brands were offset by the positive impact from the Western European Tissue divestiture. Organic sales were up 10% behind a 7% increase in organic volume. Net earnings increased 20% for the quarter to $514 million. Earnings increased due to sales growth, higher gross margin from a combination of manufacturing cost savings projects and positive mix impact due to the Western Europe Tissue divestiture and lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. Net earnings in Corporate increased $161 million versus the year-ago period. The increase was driven primarily by corporate hedging impacts and higher current period divestiture gains primarily from the sale of ThermaCare, partially offset by higher restructuring spending. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities was $3.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the comparable prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on the sale of businesses) provided $4.2 billion of operating cash. This was partially offset by an increase in working capital due to higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory to support business growth. Investing Activities Investing activities in the current year used $412 million, compared to the prior year period cash use of $419 million. Capital expenditures were $699 million or 3.2% of net sales for the quarter. Proceeds from asset sales generated $545 million in cash primarily from the sale of ThermaCare and the Western European Tissue business. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, consumed $292 million of cash. Financing Activities Total cash used by financing activities was $1.5 billion versus $3.6 billion in the comparable prior year period. We repurchased $3.9 billion of treasury shares under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. We increased our debt position by $3.2 billion during the quarter primarily to fund share repurchases. In the prior year period, we repurchased $2.6 billion of treasury shares and reduced our debt position by $385 million. As of September 30, 2008, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $13.2 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share buyback programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which despite the current credit crisis have and should enable us to continue to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. However, if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market, it could impair our ability to fund discretionary spending such as the previously announced share buyback program. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth ; Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the July-September quarter: Less: Foreign Exchange Impact Less: Acquisition/Divestiture Impact Free Cash Flow; Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2008. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on page 54, and Note 6, Risk Management Activities, which appears on pages 65-66 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, A. G. Lafley, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Clayton C. Daley, Jr., performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. Lafley and Daley have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. Lafley and Daley, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, and taxes. Recently, the Company has become subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in the European Union. In July 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In April 2008, UK authorities initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Company’s subsidiaries. In June 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Belgium, Romania and Greece. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws. We are now discussing the situation with the German authorities. In response to the actions of the Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, which are ongoing. The Company has identified some violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A below for additional information. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, such as Gillette, could impact our business results. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of The Gillette Company. Specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. In addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Our costs in 2008 were impacted by higher commodity costs. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which could require the Company to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. Our Company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our Company’s results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to the current credit crisis. The company currently generates significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditions resulting from the recent disruption in credit markets pose a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. If the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, or supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets.

On October 29, 2008, The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), an Ohio corporation, issued a news release announcing the commencement of the averaging period and clarifying the conditions for its exchange offer related to the separation of P&G’s coffee business and the previously announced merger of The Folgers Coffee Company (“Folgers”) and The J. M. Smucker Company (“Smucker”), pursuant to which a Smucker subsidiary will merge with and into Folgers, with Folgers surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. A copy of the news release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, on October 29, 2008, P&G also announced the following information regarding Folgers’ performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2009: “As previously disclosed, the company plans to separate the Folgers business in the October – December quarter. This business is comprised of P&G’s coffee category, a component of P&G’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Health reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business. The company provided a brief summary of results for the Folgers business for the July – September quarter. These results represent the business as currently operated as a component of P&G, including PGP, and are not directly comparable to the historical results of Folgers as a stand alone entity as presented in its recently filed registration statement related to the transaction with The J. M. Smucker Company. The differences are primarily related to P&G management reporting conventions and do not have a material impact on the underlying business trends. Folgers net sales for July-September quarter were up 11 percent to $445 million primarily due to the benefit of pricing actions in prior periods to recover higher green coffee bean costs. Volume increased one percent as gains in retail channels were offset by a decline in PGP volume. Market share was flat period over period. After tax earnings for the Folgers business for the July-September quarter were $67.4 million, an increase of 10 percent versus the prior year period. Earnings increased behind the benefit of higher unit volume, cost savings, and favorable green coffee bean market conditions. Results for the quarter also included the benefit of $13 million in reduced overhead costs, primarily as the result of reduced current period overhead allocations from P&G in preparation for the planned separation. These benefits were offset by $17 million in insurance proceeds in the base period related to Hurricane Katrina. Consistent with Folgers pricing policy, Folgers recently announced a list price decrease across the majority of its product offering in response to declining green coffee bean prices.” ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Smucker and Folgers have filed registration statements with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registering the shares of Folgers common stock and Smucker common shares to be issued to P&G shareholders in connection with the Folgers transaction. In connection with the exchange offer for the shares of common stock of Folgers, P&G filed on October 8, 2008 a tender offer statement with the SEC. P&G shareholders are urged to read the prospectus included in the registration statements, the tender offer statement and any other relevant documents, because they contain important information about Smucker, Folgers and the proposed transaction.

The results of operations for the three-month and six-month period ended December 31, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of annual results. Comprehensive Income – Total comprehensive income is comprised primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges and net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. Total comprehensive income for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $2,644 million and $4,086 million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, total comprehensive income was $2,392 million and $8,199 million, respectively. Segment Information – Following is a summary of segment results. SEGMENT INFORMATION Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – Goodwill as of December 31, 2008 is allocated by reportable segment and global business unit as follows (amounts in millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 Beauty, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 Grooming, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 Health Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 Snacks and Pet Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 Fabric Care and Home Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 Baby Care and Family Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 GOODWILL, Net, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, December 31, 2008 $357 million of the decrease in goodwill from June 30, 2008 in Snacks and Pet Care is due to the divestiture of the Coffee business. Identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2008 are comprised of (amounts in millions): Amortizable intangible assets with determinable lives Intangible assets with indefinite lives Total identifiable intangible assets Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of brands. The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $150 million and $155 million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 the amortization expense of intangible assets was $310 million and $312 million, Pursuant to SFAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the “fair-value based” method). Total share-based compensation for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 SFAS 123(R) Stock Options Total Share-Based Compensation Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. Postretirement Benefits – The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31 Three Months Ended December 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss/ (Gain) Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) Six Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss/ (Gain) Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) For the year ending June 30, 2009, the expected return on plan assets is 7.4% and 9.3% for pension and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. Fair Value Measurements On July 1, 2008 the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157) for certain financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The statement requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. Fair Value Hierarchy Under the SFAS 157 hierarchy, an entity is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2008 that are measured on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Investment securities (1) Total assets at fair value Liabilities at fair value: Total liabilities at fair value Investment securities consist primarily of non-qualified retirement plan assets. These securities are generally valued using observable market prices in active markets, with some securities valued using unobservable market prices in inactive markets. These investment securities are included within Other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for each period presented. Derivatives consist of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity derivative instruments. Foreign currency derivatives consist primarily of forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months and currency swaps with maturities up to 5 years. The Company can use such instruments to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted sales, inventory purchases, intercompany royalties, intercompany and external loans and its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally valued using observable forward rates in commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swaps. Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These interest rate derivatives are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps. Commodity derivatives consist of futures, swaps and options with maturities up to 5 years. We use these derivatives to manage a portion of the volatility in the cost of raw materials utilized in our products or production processes resulting from weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. These market instruments generally are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. These contracts are generally measured using quoted commodity exchange prices in active markets and quoted commodity exchange prices for identical commodities. A small portion of these instruments are also valued using unobservable market prices in inactive markets. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending Level 3 financial assets and liabilities balances for the six months ended December 31, 2008. Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in earnings (or changes in net assets) Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in OCI Net purchases, issuances and settlements Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 December 31, 2008 Balance In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Based on this guidance, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as they relate to long-lived assets effective July 1, 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R) and SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS 160). SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 revise the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations and non-controlling interests, including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price), the impacts of partial and step-acquisitions (including the valuation of net assets attributable to non-acquired minority interests) and post acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will be effective for the company during our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 161 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe, including investigations initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 by the European Commission with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries. We believe these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no significant formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, which are ongoing. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. As these matters evolve the Company will, if necessary, recognize the appropriate reserves. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears on pages 73-74 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Form 10-K/A Amendment No. 1 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which was filed on October 3, 2008. Discontinued Operations In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its Coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all shares of Folgers common stock, resulting in an increase of treasury stock of $2,466 million. Pursuant to the merger, a Smucker subsidiary merged with and into Folgers and Folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after tax gain on the transaction of $2,011, or $0.63 per share, which is included in Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2008. The Coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reporting segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business which is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the Coffee business: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Earnings from discontinued operations Gain on sale of discontinued operations Deferred tax benefit on gain Net earnings from discontinued operations Reclassification The Company has reclassified certain amounts in the prior period Statements of Cash Flows to be consistent with the current period presentation. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities, which is consistent with the use of the instruments and their related cash flows. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 Results of Operations – Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation of these measures at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We continue to expand our presence in “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Japan) and four developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India/Korea). In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its Coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all the common shares of Folgers, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after tax gain on the transaction of $2.0 billion, or $0.63 per share, which is included in Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the period ended December 2008. The Coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reporting segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business which is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended December 31, 2008 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the six months ended December 31, 2008 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2008: Net sales grew 3% to $42.0 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, also increased 3%. Unit volume decreased 1%, and organic volume was in line with the prior year period. Net earnings increased 32% to $8.4 billion. Net earnings increased primarily due to the gain on the Folgers transaction, as the benefit from increased net sales on the continuing operations was largely offset by a decline in operating margin. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.61, an increase of 37% versus the comparable prior year period. Operating cash flow was $5.6 billion, a decrease of 20% versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings, was 51%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. The following details a number of circumstances which could impact our ability to successfully achieve our business objectives. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected herein, please refer to our recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must manage and integrate key acquisitions including achieving the cost and growth synergies in accordance with stated goals. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, significant credit or liquidity issues, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to a global or regional credit crisis or terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competition and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property and competition law matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2008 versus the three months ended December 31, 2007. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended December 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales for the quarter were down 3% to $20.4 billion on a 3% decline in unit volume. The Company’s net sales were negatively impacted by the global economic downturn, credit crisis and associated currency market volatility. These factors are expected to continue and negatively impact net sales for the remainder of the fiscal year. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 5% as the U.S. Dollar appreciated versus the Euro, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. Price increases to recover rising commodity costs and product mix added 4% and 1%, respectively, to net sales. The unit volume decline was driven by trade inventory reductions, market contractions and market share declines. Unit volume declined in every reportable segment except Baby Care and Family Care, and was down in both developed and developing markets. Organic sales increased 2% for the quarter led by the Baby Care and Family Care segment and the Snacks and Pet Care segment. Net Sales Change Drivers 2008 vs. 2007 (Three Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin was down 70 basis points for the quarter to 51.6% of net sales. Higher commodity and energy costs reduced gross margin by approximately 300 basis points. This was partially offset by the impact of price increases and manufacturing cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 2% to $6.3 billion. Both overhead and marketing spending declined for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points largely due to cost for incremental restructuring activities undertaken to offset dilution from the divestiture of Folgers. The impact of overhead productivity programs and marketing spending efficiencies offset the negative scale impact of lower net sales. Interest expense declined 9% for the quarter to $354 million driven mainly by a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income decreased $102 million to $91 million primarily due to lower interest income. Interest income declined as a result of lower U.S. dollar interest rates and a reduction of cash balances. The effective tax rate on continuing operations declined 160 basis points to 25.7% reflecting the net effect of foreign mix, audit settlements and the effects of foreign repatriations. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 7% to $3.0 billion primarily due to lower net sales and reduced operating margin. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.94, down 2% versus the prior year. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $2.0 billion for the quarter primarily due to the $2.0 billion after tax gain on the divestiture of Folgers. Net earnings during the quarter increased 53% to $5.0 billion. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.58, up 61% versus the prior year. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of our share repurchase program and shares tendered for the Folgers transaction. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2008 versus the six months ended December 31, 2007. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Six Months Ended December 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales for the fiscal year to date increased 3% to $42.0 billion. Unit volume declined 1%, while price increases across all segments to offset commodity-driven cost increases added 4% to net sales. Baby Care and Family Care, Beauty and developing market unit volume each increased low-single-digits; while the remaining reportable segments and developed markets all had low-single-digit volume declines. Net sales increased in the Baby Care and Family Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Beauty; and Fabric Care and Home Care segments, partially offset by declines in the Grooming and Health Care Net Sales Change Drivers 2008 vs. 2007 (Six Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin was down 160 basis points to 51.2% of net sales fiscal year to date. Commodity-driven cost impacts reduced gross margin by over 300 basis points. This was partially offset by the impact of price increases and manufacturing cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were in line with the prior year period at $12.7 billion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down 80 basis points. Both overhead and marketing spending were down as a percentage of net sales primarily due to scale leverage, overhead productivity improvements and marketing spending efficiencies, partially offset by cost for incremental restructuring activities undertaken to offset dilution from the divestiture of Folgers. The net impact of foreign exchange transactional gains and losses on working capital balances contributed half of the decline in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Interest expense declined 7% to $693 million fiscal year to date driven mainly by a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income increased $41 million to $427 million as higher divestiture gains were partially offset by lower interest income. The base period included a gain on the sale of our adult incontinence business in Japan and tissue business in Western Europe, while the current period included gains on the sale of Thermacare, Dantrium and Dryel. Interest income declined as a result of lower U.S. dollar interest rates and a reduction of cash balances. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was down to 27.1% from 27.3%. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 1% to $6.2 billion. Net earnings increased primarily due to higher net sales, lower interest expense and higher non-operating income, partially offset by reduced operating margin. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.95, up 5% versus the prior year. Net earnings for discontinued operations increased $2.0 billion fiscal year to date mainly due to the after tax gain on the divestiture of Folgers. Net earnings increased 32% fiscal year to date to $8.4 billion largely as a result of the Folgers transaction gain. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.61, up 37% versus the prior year. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of our share repurchase program and shares tendered for the Folgers transaction. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 are provided compared to the same three and six month periods ended December 31, 2007. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Six Months Ended December 31, 2008 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Beauty net sales decreased 4% to $4.9 billion for the quarter. Net sales were down due to a 1% decline in volume and a 4% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by a 1% positive pricing impact. Organic sales were in line with the previous year. Retail Hair Care volume grew low-single digits behind growth in developing regions and mid-single-digit or higher global growth of Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Rejoice and Nice ‘N Easy. Professional Hair Care volume declined mid-single-digits primarily due to market contractions. Personal Cleansing volume decreased high-single-digits due to trade inventory reductions and market contractions. Volume in Skin Care decreased mid-single-digits mainly due to the divestiture of Noxzema. Cosmetics volume was down mid-single-digits due to trade inventory reductions. Prestige Fragrances volume decreased high-single-digits due mainly to market contractions and a shift in initiative timings to the second half of fiscal 2009. Net earnings declined 10% during the quarter to $799 million primarily due to lower operating margin and a reduction in net sales. Operating margin declined as lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was more than offset by the impact of higher commodity costs. Beauty net sales increased 3% fiscal year to date to $10.1 billion. Volume increases, positive pricing, and favorable foreign exchange each contributed 1% to net sales growth. Organic sales increased 3%. Retail Hair Care volume grew mid-single-digits behind growth in developing regions. Professional Hair Care volume declined mid-single-digits due to market contractions. Cosmetics volume grew low-single-digits behind mid-single-digit growth of Cover Girl. Volume in Skin Care declined low-single-digits due to the divestiture of Noxzema. Personal Cleansing volume was down low-single-digits behind trade inventory reductions and market contractions. Prestige Fragrances volume declined mid-single-digits due to market contractions and a shift in initiative timings to the second half of fiscal 2009. Net earnings decreased 1% fiscal year to date to $1.6 billion as sales growth and lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by reduced gross margin from the impact of higher commodity costs. Grooming Grooming net sales declined 7% during the quarter to $2.0 billion on a 6% decline in unit volume. Price increases taken across premium shaving systems added 4% to net sales. Product mix contributed 1% to net sales behind continued growth of premium innovations such as Gillette Fusion. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%. Organic sales increased 1% for the quarter. Unit volume declined primarily due to a double-digit decline of Braun. Blades and Razors volume decreased low-single-digits driven primarily by trade inventory reductions and market contractions in North America and Western Europe. Double-digit growth of Gillette Fusion was offset by a high-single-digit decline of Mach3. Global value share of the blades and razors category increased by 1 percent. Braun volume declined behind market contractions, the exits of the U.S. home appliance and Tassimo coffee appliance businesses and trade inventory reductions. Global value share of the dry shaving category increased half of a point to nearly 35%. Net earnings decreased 3% to $416 million for the quarter primarily due to lower net sales, partially offset by higher operating margin. Operating margins increased due to lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales and the positive gross margin impact of price increases and improved mix, partially offset by higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Grooming net sales were down 1% to $4.2 billion fiscal year to date on a 3% decline in unit volume. Price increases taken across premium shaving systems added 3% to net sales. Product mix had a negative 1% impact on net sales as favorable product mix from growth on Gillette Fusion was more than offset by disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Organic sales were consistent with the prior year to date period. Volume in Blades and Razors was consistent with previous year as growth in developing regions was offset by trade inventory reductions and market contractions in North America and Western Europe. Double-digit growth of Gillette Fusion and mid-single-digit growth of Venus were offset by declines in Mach3 and disposables. Global value share of the blades and razors category increased over half a point to about 70%. Volume in Braun was down due to market contractions, the exits of the U.S. home appliance and Tassimo coffee appliance businesses and trade inventory reductions. Global value share of the dry shaving category increased over 1 point to about 36%. Net earnings increased 2% to $894 million on higher operating margin. Operating margin increased behind lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales and the positive gross margin impact of price increases and improved mix, partially offset by higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales were down 6% during the quarter to $3.5 billion on a 3% volume decline. Unfavorable foreign exchange and negative product mix reduced net sales by 5% and 1%, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by a positive pricing impact of 3%. Organic sales were in line with the prior year as positive pricing offset declining volume and negative product mix. Personal Health Care volume decreased double-digits due to a double-digit decline of Prilosec OTC from the loss of marketplace exclusivity in North America and the ThermaCare divestiture. P&G’s all-outlet value share of the U.S. stomach remedies market has declined about nine points to about 29 percent. Pharmaceuticals volume declined mid-single-digits primarily as a result of minor brand divestitures. Feminine Care volume was flat as double-digit growth of Naturella was offset by a mid-single-digit decline of Tampax. Oral Care volume decreased low-single-digits behind lower shipments of Crest primarily in China from trade inventory reductions and transition issues while implementing a new mid-tier brand restage. For the quarter, net earnings decreased 10% to $647 million primarily due to the decline of net sales and lower operating margin driven primarily by higher commodity costs. Health Care net sales declined 1% fiscal year to date to $7.2 billion on a 2% decline in unit volume. Price increases added 3% to net sales, while negative product mix reduced net sales by 2% resulting primarily from lower shipments of Prilosec OTC. Organic sales were in line with the prior year period. Personal Health Care volume was down low-double-digits due to a double-digit decline of Prilosec OTC from the loss of marketplace exclusivity in North America and the divestiture of ThermaCare. Pharmaceuticals volume decreased mid-single-digits due to minor brand divestitures. Oral Care volume was consistent with previous year results as low-single-digit growth of Oral B was offset by a low-single-digit decline of Crest. Feminine Care volume grew low-single-digits due to growth in developing regions behind Always and Naturella. Net earnings declined 4% to $1.3 billion due to lower net sales and a commodity cost-driven decline in gross margin, partially offset by lower overhead spending as a percentage of sales. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales decreased 1% to $791 million for the quarter on a unit volume decline of 5%. Net sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and negative product mix of 1%. Price increases to recover higher commodity costs contributed 10% to net sales. Volume in Snacks declined mid-single-digits due to supply constraints in North America. Volume in Pet Care was down mid-single-digits due to declining shipments to the pet specialty channel in response to multiple price increases. Net earnings declined 6% to $63 million for the quarter primarily due to lower gross margin from higher commodity costs, partially offset by lower overhead and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales. Snacks and Pet Care net sales increased 4% fiscal year to date to $1.6 billion behind positive pricing impacts of 8%. Lower volume and unfavorable foreign exchange each reduced net sales by 1%. Product mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% due to lower shipments of Eukanuba and premium snack products, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Volume in Snacks increased low-single-digits behind mid-single-digit growth in North America. Pet Care volume declined mid-single-digits due to consumption declines following multiple price increases, which resulted in overall pet care sales increasing mid-single-digits. Net earnings were consistent with previous year results at $118 million as higher net sales and lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were offset by lower gross margin from higher commodity costs and a higher effective tax rate. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales decreased 4% to $5.8 billion for the quarter on a 6% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 5% during the quarter. Price increases to offset commodity costs had a positive impact of 6% on net sales and positive mix added an additional 1%. Organic sales grew 1%. Fabric Care volume decreased mid-single-digits primarily due to a double-digit reduction of Tide shipments from trade inventory reductions and market share declines. U.S. all-outlet value share of the detergents category was down over two points as lower shares on Tide and minor brands were partially offset by increases on the Gain brand. Home Care volume was down low-single digits as growth of Air Care was more than offset by declines of Dish Care and Surface Care following price increases. Batteries volume was down low-double-digits behind market contractions, trade inventory reductions and market share declines. Global value share of general purpose batteries was down slightly to about 28%. Net earnings declined 25% to $658 million primarily due to a decline in net sales and lower gross margin from higher commodity costs. Higher overhead spending as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 3% to $12.3 billion fiscal year to date. Price increases contributed 5% to net sales and more than offset a 2% decline in unit volume. Fabric Care volume declined low-single-digits as lower shipments of Tide due to trade inventory reductions and market share declines were mostly offset by growth of Gain and Downy. U.S. all-outlet value share of the detergents category was down over two points as lower shares on Tide and minor brands were partially offset by increases on the Gain brand. Home Care volume declined low-single-digits due to the Febreze Candles initiatives in the base period and volume softness following price increases on Dish Care and Surface Care. Batteries volume was down mid-single-digits due to market contractions, trade inventory reductions and market share declines. Net earnings declined 17% to $1.5 billion as increased net sales were more than offset by reduced operating margin. Operating margin declined primarily due to reduced gross margin, driven by higher commodity costs. Higher overhead spending as a percentage of net sales was more than offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 3% during the quarter to $3.5 billion on 1% unit volume growth. Price increases to recover higher commodity and energy costs contributed 7% to sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 4%. Product mix from the disproportionate growth in developing regions and a shift toward larger pack counts, which have lower than segment average selling prices, negatively impacted net sales by 1%. Volume in Baby Care increased low-single-digits due to growth of Pampers in developing regions. Volume in Family Care decreased low-single-digits as lower shipments of Charmin more than offset growth of Bounty. Net earnings were consistent with previous year results at $418 million as higher net sales were offset by lower operating margins and a higher effective tax rate. Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 7% to $7.2 billion fiscal year to date on 1% volume growth. Pricing to help recover higher commodity and energy costs contributed 6% to net sales growth. Volume in Baby Care increased mid-single-digits due to growth of Pampers in developing regions and double-digit growth of Luvs in North America. Family Care volume declined low-single-digits due to the Western European Tissue divestiture. Organic volume for Family Care was up low-single-digits behind double-digit growth of Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. Family Care U.S. value share was up nearly one point to over 32%. Organic sales were up 9% year to date behind a 4% increase in organic volume. Net earnings increased 10% to $932 million due to sales growth and higher gross margin. Fiscal year to date gross margin increased as the impact of price increases, manufacturing cost savings and the positive mix impact of the Western European Tissue and Towel divestiture more than offset higher commodity and energy costs. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. For the Corporate segment, net expenses from continuing operations decreased $157 million to $39 million for the quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by corporate hedging impacts and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher restructuring spending. Fiscal year to date, net expenses from continuing operations decreased $330 million. The decrease was primarily due to corporate hedging impacts, higher current period divestiture gains and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher restructuring spending. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period was $5.6 billion, a decrease of 20% versus the comparable prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on the sale of businesses) provided $8.0 billion of operating cash. This was partially offset by an increase in working capital, driven primarily by inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. Inventory increased primarily due to higher input costs and the decline in unit volume, which drove a 2 day increase in the amount of inventory on hand. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to seasonality of certain business categories such as prestige fragrances, batteries and appliances, which have higher relative sales leading up to the holiday season. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities levels declined due to earlier relative payment timing for marketing and other operating expenses, along with the timing of interest payments on debt. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed $96 million to operating cash flow. Investing Activities Investing activities in the current year used $675 million. Capital expenditures were $1,421 million fiscal year to date or 3.4% of net sales. Proceeds from asset sales generated $1,017 million in cash primarily from the Noxzema, Coffee and Western European Tissue divestitures. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, consumed $323 million of cash mainly due to the Nioxin acquisition. Cash flow from discontinued operations consumed $3 million of investing cash flow. Financing Activities Total cash used by financing activities was $2.4 billion fiscal year to date. Treasury shares in the amount of $5.2 billion were repurchased under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. Dividends to shareholders used $2.5 billion. These uses of cash were partially funded by an increase in the Company’s debt position of $4.8 billion. As of December 31, 2008, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $11.7 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share buyback programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which despite the current credit crisis have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. However, if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market, it could impair our ability to fund discretionary spending such as the previously announced share buyback program. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the October - December quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact Fabric Care and Home Care The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact Baby Care and Family Care Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2008. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on page 54, and Note 6, Risk Management Activities, which appears on pages 65-66 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A Amendment No. 1 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which was filed on October 3, 2008. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, A. G. Lafley, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. Lafley and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. Lafley and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters and taxes. The Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. In July 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In April 2008, UK authorities initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Company’s subsidiaries. In June 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, France and Greece. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws. We are now discussing the situation with the German authorities. In response to the actions of the Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, which are ongoing. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A below for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities are currently investigating whether the Company’s affiliates complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. While no judicial proceeding has been initiated, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100,000 against the Company’s European affiliate(s), should they find that these entities violated the law. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, such as Gillette, could impact our business results. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of The Gillette Company. Specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. In addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Our costs in 2008 were impacted by higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2009. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which could require the Company to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. Our Company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our Company’s results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to the current credit crisis. The Company currently generates significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditions resulting from the recent disruption in credit markets pose a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. If the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid per Share (2) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (3) Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under our share repurchase program ($ in Billions) (3) (4) The total number of shares purchased was 59,242,766 for the quarter. Except for those shares described in footnote 5 below, all transactions were made in the open market or pursuant to prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions. Under the prepaid forward agreements, the Company prepaid large financial institutions to deliver shares at future dates in exchange for a discount. The number of shares purchased other than through a publicly announced repurchase plan was 21,913 for the quarter. This number excludes the 38,652,878 shares described in footnote 5 below but includes shares acquired by the Company under various compensation and benefit plans. This table excludes shares withheld from employees to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements on option exercises and other equity-based transactions. The Company administers cashless exercises through an independent, third party broker and does not repurchase stock in connection with cashless exercise. Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission. On August 3, 2007, the Company announced a share repurchase plan. Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, the Board of Directors authorized the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire in open market and/or private transactions $24 to $30 billion of shares of Company common stock over the subsequent three years to be financed by issuing a combination of long-term and short-term debt. Certain purchases were made prior to announcement of the program but are considered purchases against the program. The dollar values listed in this column include commissions to be paid to brokers to execute the transactions. This includes 38,652,878 shares acquired in November 2008 in exchange for 63,166,532 shares of The Folgers Coffee Company as part of the previously disclosed reverse Morris Trust transaction with The J. M. Smucker Company. This does not apply to the 38,652,878 shares described in footnote 5 above.

Smucker Company (“Smucker”) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of P&G common stock were tendered by the Company’s shareholders and exchanged for all shares of Folgers common stock. Pursuant to the merger, a Smucker subsidiary merged with and into Folgers, and Folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. Historically, the Company’s coffee business was part of its Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business which is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, the Company is now required to present the results of Folgers as discontinued operations.

The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month period ended March 31, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of annual results. Comprehensive Income—Total comprehensive income is comprised primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges and net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. Total comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 was $504 million and $4,389 million, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, total comprehensive income was $2,896 million and $12,588 million, respectively. Segment Information – Following is a summary of segment results. SEGMENT INFORMATION Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – Goodwill as of March 31, 2009 is allocated by reportable segment and global business unit as follows (amounts in millions): Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 Beauty, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Grooming, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Health Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Snacks and Pet Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Fabric Care and Home Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Baby Care and Family Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures GOODWILL, Net, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures $357 million of the decrease in goodwill from June 30, 2008 in Snacks and Pet Care is due to the divestiture of the Coffee business. The remaining decrease in goodwill from June 30, 2008 is primarily due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets as of March 31, 2009 are comprised of (amounts in millions): Amortizable intangible assets with determinable lives Intangible assets with indefinite lives Total identifiable intangible assets Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of brands. The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 was $149 million and $156 million, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 the amortization expense of intangible assets was $459 million and $468 million, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,” companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (the “fair-value based” method). Total share-based compensation for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 SFAS 123(R) Stock Options Total Share-Based Compensation Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. Postretirement Benefits—The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Three Months Ended March 31 Three Months Ended March 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss/ (Gain) Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) Nine Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss/ (Gain) Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) For the year ending June 30, 2009, the expected return on plan assets is 7.4% and 9.3% for pension and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. Fair Value Measurements On July 1, 2008 the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157) for certain financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The statement requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. Fair Value Hierarchy Under the SFAS 157 hierarchy, an entity is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2009 that are measured on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Investment securities (1) Total assets at fair value Liabilities at fair value: Total liabilities at fair value Investment securities consist primarily of non-qualified retirement plan assets. These securities are generally valued using observable market prices in active markets, with some securities valued using unobservable market prices in inactive markets. These investment securities are included within Other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for each period presented. Derivatives consist of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity financial instruments. See Note 8 for additional details on our risk management activities. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending Level 3 financial assets and liabilities balances for the nine months ended March 31, 2009. Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in earnings (or changes in net assets) Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in OCI Net purchases, issuances and settlements Transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Based on this guidance, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as they relate to long-lived assets effective July 1, 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. Risk Management Activities As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of logical exposure netting and correlation. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the remaining net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions, which we account for under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. Any ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument, which is immaterial for all periods presented, is immediately recognized in earnings. For additional details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s annual financial statements and footnotes in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, as updated by the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 10, 2009. The location, fair value and fair value hierarchy level of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions at March 31, 2009 are as follows: Prepaid expenses & Other noncurrent assets Total assets at fair value Liabilities at fair value: Accrued liabilities & Other noncurrent liabilities Total liabilities at fair value Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the deal. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of March 31, 2009 was $712 million. The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these The locations and amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 are as follows: Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative (Effective Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (Effective Portion) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (Effective Portion) Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Foreign currency contracts (1) Selling, general and administrative expense Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion) Location of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Ineffective Portion and Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Ineffective Portion and Amount Excluded from Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Net investment hedges (3) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Location of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Foreign currency contracts (4) (5) Selling, general and administrative expense Foreign currency cash flow hedges consist of currency swaps with maturities of up to 5 years. The fair value of these instruments offsets the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Commodity hedges consist of futures and options with maturities generally less than 1 year and swap contracts with maturities up to 5 years. We use these instruments to manage a portion of the volatility in the cost of raw materials used in our products or production processes resulting from weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. The change in fair value of these instruments offsets the effect of fluctuations in costs for forecasted purchases of commodities used in the manufacturing process. Net investment hedges consist of both direct borrowings in foreign currencies and foreign currency swaps which are designated as hedges of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Changes to the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Certain of our foreign currency instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and other balance sheet items are not designated as hedges. In these cases, the change in the fair value of the instruments is designed to substantially offset the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. Total fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments included $367 million of foreign currency contracts in a liability position and $161 million of foreign currency contracts in an asset position. The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R) and SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS 160). SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 revise the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations and non-controlling interests, including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price), the impacts of partial and step-acquisitions (including the valuation of net assets attributable to non-acquired minority interests) and post acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will be effective for the Company during our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 161 did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe, including investigations initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 by the European Commission with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries. We believe these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no significant formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, some of which are ongoing. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. As these matters evolve the Company will, if necessary, recognize the appropriate reserves. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Form 8-K filed February 10, Discontinued Operations In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its Coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all shares of Folgers common stock, resulting in an increase of treasury stock of $2,466 million. Pursuant to the merger, a Smucker subsidiary merged with and into Folgers and Folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after tax gain on the transaction of $2,011, or $0.63 per share, which is included in Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2009. The Coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business which is included in the Fabric and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations for the Coffee business: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Earnings from discontinued operations Gain on sale of discontinued operations Deferred tax benefit on gain Net earnings from discontinued operations The $28 million of Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 consist primarily of a gain on the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Reclassification The Company has reclassified certain amounts in the prior period Statements of Cash Flows to be consistent with the current period presentation. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities, which is consistent with the use of the instruments and their related cash flows. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 Results of Operations – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our goal is to provide products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores. We continue to expand our presence in “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas comprised of three developed regions (North America, Western Europe and Japan) and four developing regions (Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India/Korea). In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its Coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all the common shares of Folgers, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after tax gain on the transaction of $2.0 billion, or $0.63 per share, which is included in Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the nine month period ended March 31, 2009. The Coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of the P&G Professional (PGP) business which is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2009 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2009: Net sales declined 1% to $60.4 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 3%. Unit and organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, both decreased 2% versus the prior-year period. Net earnings increased 21% to $11.0 billion. Net earnings increased due to the gain on the Folgers transaction. Net earnings from continuing operations were flat versus the prior year period as lower net sales and a decline in operating margin were offset by lower interest expense, higher gains from divestitures and a lower tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share were $3.46, an increase of 27% versus the comparable prior-year period. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion, a decrease of 11% versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings, was 71%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. The following details a number of circumstances which could impact our ability to successfully achieve our business objectives. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected herein, please refer to our recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must manage and integrate key acquisitions including achieving the cost and growth synergies in accordance with stated goals. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in volatile countries. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce rationalization. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, significant credit or liquidity issues, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to a global or regional credit crisis or terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competition and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property and competition law matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2009 versus the three months ended March 31, 2008. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended March 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales for the quarter decreased 8% to $18.4 billion on a 5% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 9% as many foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Price increases added 7% to net sales, while product mix had a negative 1% impact on net sales. All reportable segments except Baby Care and Family Care experienced volume declines. Both developed and developing markets declined mid-single digits driven primarily by market contractions and continued trade inventory reductions. These impacts were most acute across the Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA) region, where more pronounced price increases were necessary to maintain the structural economics of businesses as the devaluation of local currencies increased the local cost of dollar-denominated inputs costs. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in the Baby Care and Family Care, the Fabric Care and Home Care and the Snacks and Pet Care segments. The Company’s net sales were negatively impacted by the global economic downturn, credit crisis and associated currency market volatility. These factors are expected to continue and negatively impact net sales for the remainder of the fiscal year and beginning of next fiscal year. Net Sales Change Drivers 2009 vs. 2008 (Three Months Ended Mar. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin for the quarter was 50.3% of net sales, a decline of 140 basis points versus the prior-year period. Higher commodity and energy costs lowered gross margin by about 200 basis points. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, negative product mix and incremental restructuring charges also reduced gross margin for the quarter. These were largely offset by the impact of price increases and manufacturing cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 13% to $5.5 billion for the quarter due to currency impacts and cost reduction efforts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points primarily due to lower marketing spending and the impact of foreign currency transaction gains on working capital balances caused by strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These impacts were partially offset by increased overhead costs as a percentage of net sales as the impact of overhead productivity programs was more than offset by the negative scale impact of lower net sales and the cost of incremental restructuring activities. Incremental restructuring activities undertaken to offset dilution from the Folgers divestiture reduced operating margins by approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. Interest expense declined 8% for the quarter to $336 million driven mainly by a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income increased $83 million to $93 million primarily due to gains on the divestiture of minor brands. The effective tax rate on continuing operations declined 170 basis points to 25.9% primarily due to audit settlements in a number of countries. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 2% to $2.6 billion primarily due to reduced net sales and operating income, partially offset by a lower tax rate. The overall decline in operating income was driven primarily by foreign-exchange impacts, as most major currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.83, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. Net earnings from discontinued operations were $28 million consisting primarily of a gain on the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. This represents a decline of 53% versus the prior-year period caused by the loss of contribution from the Folgers business divested in the December quarter. Net earnings were down 4% to $2.6 billion during the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 2% to $0.84. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of our share repurchase program and shares tendered for the Folgers transaction. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2008. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amount in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Nine Months Ended March 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales decreased 1% to $60.4 billion fiscal year to date on a 2% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3% as many foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Negative product mix lowered net sales by 1%. Price increases across all segments to offset commodity-driven cost increases added 5% to net sales. Every reportable segment, except Baby Care and Family Care, reported volume declines led by a high single-digit decline of Grooming and mid-single-digit decline in Health Care. Developed market volume declined low single-digits and developing market volume was in line with prior-year results. Organic sales increased 3% versus the prior year period driven by growth of the Baby Care and Family Care, Snacks and Pet Care, Beauty and Fabric Care and Home Care segments. The global economic downturn, credit crisis and price increases have contributed to market contractions, trade inventory reductions and share declines in certain businesses, resulting in organic sales below the Company’s long-term financial target range. Net Sales Change Drivers 2009 vs. 2008 (Nine Months Ended Mar. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin was down 150 basis points to 50.9% of net sales fiscal year to date. Commodity-driven cost impacts reduced gross margin by about 300 basis points. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, negative product mix and incremental restructuring charges also negatively impacted gross margin. These impacts were partially offset by price increases and manufacturing cost savings projects. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were down 4% versus the prior-year period to $18.2 billion primarily due to foreign currency impacts and cost reduction efforts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined 110 basis points due to lower marketing spending and the net impact of foreign exchange transactional gains and losses on working capital balances, partially offset by cost for incremental restructuring activities undertaken to offset dilution from the divestiture of Folgers. Incremental restructuring activities undertaken to offset dilution from the Folgers divestiture reduced operating margins by approximately 40 basis points fiscal year to date. Interest expense declined 7% to $1.0 billion fiscal year to date driven mainly by a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income increased $124 million to $520 million as higher divestiture gains were partially offset by lower interest income. The base period divestiture gains resulted primarily from the sale of our adult incontinence business in Japan and tissue business in Western Europe, while the current period gains resulted primarily from the sale of Thermacare, Dantrium, Infusium and other minor brands. Interest income declined as a result of lower U.S. dollar interest rates and a reduction of cash balances. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was down to 26.7% from 27.4% due to the net effect of foreign mix, audit settlements and the effects of foreign repatriations. Net earnings from continuing operations were in line with the prior-year period at $8.8 billion as lower net sales and reduced operating margin were offset by lower interest expense, higher divestiture gains and a lower tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.78, up 5% versus the prior year. Net earnings for discontinued operations increased $1.9 billion fiscal year to date mainly due to the after tax gain on the divestiture of Folgers. Net earnings increased 21% to $11.0 billion fiscal year to date as a result of the Folgers transaction gain. Diluted net earnings per share were $3.46, up 27% versus the prior year. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of our share repurchase program and shares tendered for the Folgers transaction. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION– Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 are provided compared to the same three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2008. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Nine Months Ended March 31, 2009 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY GBU Beauty Beauty net sales declined 9% during the quarter to $4.3 billion. Organic sales were in line with the previous year period. A 5% decline in unit volume primarily due to soft shipments in Prestige Fragrances and across the CEEMEA region was offset by positive pricing of 5% to offset higher commodity costs. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 9%. Prestige Fragrances volume declined double-digits as markets contracted and trade customers reduced inventory levels. Retail Hair Care volume was down low single-digits as a double-digit decline in CEEMEA resulting from market contractions, trade inventory reductions and share declines was partially offset by growth in most of the other regions. Volume in Professional Hair Care decreased double- digits primarily due to market contractions and trade inventory reductions. Skin Care volume declined high single-digits mainly due to trade inventory reductions and the divestiture of Noxzema. Volume in Personal Cleansing decreased mid-single-digits primarily due to trade inventory reductions and share declines, particularly in CEEMEA and Greater China. Net earnings declined 14% during the quarter to $504 million behind lower net sales, a decline in operating margin driven by reduced gross margin and a higher tax rate, partially offset by divestiture gains. Beauty net sales decreased 1% fiscal year to date to $14.4 billion on a 1% decline in unit volume. Organic volume was in line with the prior year. Price increases to offset higher commodity costs added 2% to net sales and resulted in 2% organic sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Retail Hair Care volume grew low single-digits behind growth of Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Rejoice. Prestige Fragrances volume declined double-digits and Professional Hair Care volume declined mid-single-digits due to market contractions and trade inventory reductions. Volume in Skin Care declined mid-single-digits primarily due to lower shipments of Olay and the divestiture of Noxzema. Personal Cleansing volume was down mid-single-digits behind trade inventory reductions, market contractions and divestiture activity. Net earnings decreased 5% fiscal year to date to $2.1 billion mainly due to lower net sales and reduced operating margins. A reduction in gross margin from higher commodity costs was partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Grooming Grooming net sales were down 16% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Organic sales decreased 4% versus the prior year period. Volume declined 9% primarily due to market contractions and trade inventory reductions. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 12%. Unfavorable product mix due to growth of disposables, which have lower than segment average selling prices, reduced net sales by 2%. These impacts were partially offset by positive pricing impacts of 7% mainly due to price increases taken across premium systems and to offset foreign exchange impacts. Blades and Razors volume decreased high single-digits as growth of Gillette Fusion was more than offset by declines of Mach3 and Venus. Global value share of the Blades and Razors category was flat versus the prior-year period at about 71%. Braun volume was down double-digits due to market contractions, trade inventory reductions and share softness in home appliances, particularly in developing regions. Globally, Braun’s value share of the dry shaving market was down less than half a point. For the quarter, net earnings decreased 24% to $306 million primarily due to lower net sales and a decline in operating margin. Within operating margin, a decline in gross margin from sales de-leveraging and unfavorable foreign-exchange impacts were partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Grooming net sales declined 6% fiscal year to date to $5.8 billion on a 5% decline in unit volume. Organic sales decreased 1% versus the prior year to date period. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 4% as the U.S. dollar strengthened against key foreign currencies. Product mix had a negative 1% impact on net sales as favorable product mix from growth on Gillette Fusion was more than offset by a disproportionate decline in developed regions, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Price increases taken primarily across premium shaving systems added 4% to net sales. Blades and Razors volume declined low single-digits primarily driven by market contractions in developed regions. Growth of Gillette Fusion and Venus was more than offset by declines in legacy systems. Global value share of Blades and Razors was up less than half a point and remains above 70%. Volume in Braun was down double-digits due to market contractions, the exits of the U.S. home appliance and Tassimo coffee appliance businesses and trade inventory reductions. Global value share of the Dry Shaving market was up about half a point to approximately 35%. Net earnings were down 6% versus the prior year period to $1.2 billion primarily on a decline in net sales. Reduced gross margin was partially offset by lower overhead spending as a HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Net sales in Health Care decreased 12% for the quarter to $3.2 billion on a 6% decline in unit volume. Net sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of 8%. Negative product mix reduced net sales by 3% due to disproportionately higher volume declines in Personal Health Care and Pharmaceuticals, primarily in North America, which have higher than segment average selling prices. These impacts were partially offset by a positive pricing impact of 5% resulting from price increases to recover higher commodity costs. Organic sales declined 2% for the quarter. Volume in Personal Health Care was down double-digits due to a double-digit decline of Prilosec OTC from the loss of marketplace exclusivity in North America, the impact of a mild cold and flu season on Vicks and the ThermaCare divestiture. U.S. all outlet value share of the personal health care market has declined over two points including a double-digit share decline of Prilosec OTC. Pharmaceuticals volume declined high single-digits primarily as a result of minor brand divestitures and generic competition in the U.S. weekly osteoporosis market. Feminine Care volume was down low single-digits behind market contractions and trade inventory reductions, mainly in CEEMEA. Volume in Oral Care decreased low single-digits primarily due to lower shipments of Crest in developing markets from trade inventory reductions and market contractions. Net earnings for the quarter declined 9% to $564 million mainly due to the decline in net sales. A lower gross margin from higher commodity costs was more than offset by lower marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales and minor brand divestiture gains. Health Care net sales were down 5% to $10.5 billion fiscal year to date on a 3% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Negative product mix from disproportionately higher volume declines of Personal Health Care and Pharmaceuticals, primarily in North America, also reduced net sales by 3%. These negative impacts were partially offset by positive pricing impacts of 4%. Personal Health Care volume was down double-digits due to the loss of marketplace exclusivity of Prilosec in North America, the impact of a mild cold and flu season on Vicks and the divestiture of ThermaCare. All outlet value share of the U.S. personal health care market has declined nearly three points including a double-digit share decline of Prilosec OTC. Pharmaceuticals volume decreased mid-single-digits mainly due to minor brand divestitures. Oral Care volume declined low single-digits as growth of Oral B was more than offset by a decline of Crest. Feminine Care volume was consistent with the prior year period as low single-digit growth of Always was offset by a high single-digit decline of Tampax. Organic volume was down 2% and organic sales were down 1% versus prior year period. Net earnings declined 6% to $1.9 billion fiscal year to date. Lower net sales and reduced gross margin from higher commodity costs were partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales and higher divestiture gains. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales declined 4% to $764 million during the quarter on a 6% decline in unit volume. Price increases to offset higher commodity costs added 10% to net sales. Product mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% due to lower shipments of Eukanuba and premium snack products, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%. Organic sales increased 2%. Volume in Snacks was down mid-single-digits due primarily to a high base period which included the Rice Infusion initiative in Western Europe, the Extreme Flavors initiative in North America, market share declines following price increase and trade inventory reductions. Pet Care volume declined mid-single-digits behind consumption declines in response to price increases. For the quarter, net earnings decreased 14% to $51 million as a commodity cost-driven decline in gross margin, lower net sales and a higher tax rate were partially offset by lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Snacks and Pet Care net sales increased 1% fiscal year to date to $2.4 billion behind positive pricing impacts of 9%. Lower volume and unfavorable foreign exchange each reduced net sales by 3%. Product mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% due to lower shipments of Eukanuba and premium snack products, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales grew 4%. Snacks volume decreased low single-digits primarily due to a high base period which included the Rice Infusion initiative in Western Europe, the Extreme Flavors initiative in North America, market share declines following price increase and trade inventory reductions. Volume in Pet Care declined mid-single-digits mainly due to consumption declines following multiple price increases. Fiscal year to date, net earnings were down 5% to $169 million as higher net sales and lower overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by a commodity cost-driven reduction in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Net sales in Fabric Care and Home Care were down 6% to $5.4 billion on a 5% decline in unit volume. Price increases mainly to offset higher commodity costs in developing regions added 9% to net sales. Unfavorable foreign exchange of 9% and negative product mix of 1% each reduced net sales. Organic sales increased 3% for the quarter. Volume in Fabric Care declined mid-single-digits and was down in both developed and developing markets. Share declines and market contractions in key regions following price increases on Tide and Ariel more than offset an increase in Gain and Downy shipments. Value share of global fabric care was down less than half a point and remained over 31%. Home Care volume decreased low single-digits as declines of Cascade, Dawn and Mr. Clean, following price increases, were partially offset by growth of Febreze and Swiffer. Batteries volume was down high single-digits due to market contractions, share declines and lower demand from equipment manufacturers. Global value share of general purpose batteries declined over one point to about 29%. Net earnings decreased 7% to $726 million primarily due to a decline in net sales. The impact of a higher tax rate was largely offset by higher operating margin driven by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Fiscal year to date, Fabric Care and Home Care net sales were consistent with the prior-year period at $17.7 billion on a 3% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Price increases taken to offset higher commodity costs added 6% to net sales. Organic sales increased 3% fiscal year to date. Fabric Care, Home Care and Batteries unit volume were each down in both developed and developing markets. Fabric Care volume declined low single-digits as lower shipments of Tide and Ariel due to trade inventory reductions and market share declines were only partially offset by growth of Gain and Downy. Global value share of the fabric care market was down about half a point behind declines in U.S. all outlet shares of Tide and Downy, partially offset by share growth of Gain. Home Care volume was down low single-digits due to market contractions and share declines in Dish Care and Hard Surface Cleaners following price increases. Batteries volume declined mid-single-digits due to market contractions, trade inventory reductions and market share declines. Global value share of general purpose batteries declined one point to about 28%. Net earnings declined 14% to $2.2 billion primarily due to a commodity-driven decline in gross margin and higher overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $3.5 billion on flat volume versus the prior-year period. Organic sales grew 6% behind positive pricing impacts of 6% implemented to recover higher commodity and energy costs. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 8%. Baby Care volume increased low single-digits behind growth in developed regions driven by the UNICEF Vaccine Partnership initiative in Western Europe and a double-digit increase in Luvs shipments. Family Care volume decreased low single-digits as lower shipments of Charmin were partially offset by higher shipments of Bounty. Net earnings declined 10% to $423 million primarily due to foreign exchange impacts and lower gross margin from higher commodity costs. Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 4% to $10.7 billion fiscal year to date on 1% volume growth. Pricing to help recover higher commodity and energy costs contributed 6% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange and negative product mix reduced net sales by 2% and 1%, respectively. Baby Care volume increased mid-single-digits due to growth of Pampers primarily in developing regions and double-digit growth of Luvs in North America. The growth in Baby Care was mostly offset by a low single-digit decline of Family Care due to the Western European Tissue divestiture. Organic volume for Family Care was up low single-digits behind double-digit growth of Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. Organic sales were up 8% year to date behind a 3% increase in organic volume. Net earnings increased 3% to $1.4 billion primarily due to sales growth and higher gross margin. Fiscal year to date gross margin increased as the impact of price increases, manufacturing cost savings and the positive mix impact of the Western European Tissue divestiture more than offset higher commodity and energy costs. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in overhead as a percentage of net sales. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and minority interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to minority interest. For the Corporate segment, net earnings from continuing operations increased $279 million to $11 million for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by corporate hedging impacts and tax impacts from adjusting segment results to the total company effective tax rate, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. Fiscal year to date, net expenses from continuing operations decreased $609 million to $36 million. The decrease was primarily due to corporate hedging impacts, higher current period divestiture gains and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher restructuring spending. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period was $9.9 billion, a decrease of 11% versus the comparable prior year period. The combination of net earnings and non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on the sale of businesses) provided $11.3 billion of operating cash as compared to $12.6 billion in the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase in working capital, driven primarily by inventory and accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities. Inventory increased primarily due to the decline in unit volume. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities levels declined primarily due to lower spending levels and a quicker payment cycle. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed $124 million to operating cash flow. Investing Activities Investing activities in the current year used $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.2 billion fiscal year to date or 3.6% of net sales. Proceeds from asset sales generated $1.1 billion in cash primarily from the Coffee, Thermacare and Western European Tissue divestitures. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, consumed $315 million of cash mainly due to the Nioxin acquisition. Cash flow from discontinued operations consumed $3 million of investing cash flow. Financing Activities Total cash used by financing activities was $7.2 billion fiscal year to date. Treasury shares in the amount of $6.4 billion were repurchased under a previously announced share buyback program that started in July 2007. Dividends to shareholders used $3.7 billion. These uses of cash were partially funded by an increase in the Company’s debt position of $2.3 billion. As of March 31, 2009, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $10.8 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share buyback programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which despite the current credit crisis have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. However, if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market, it could impair our ability to fund discretionary spending such as the previously announced share buyback program. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the January—March quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2008. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information in Exhibit 99.1 and Note 6, Risk Management Activities, in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 10, 2009. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, A. G. Lafley, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. Lafley and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. Lafley and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters and taxes. The Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. In July 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In April 2008, UK authorities initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Company’s subsidiaries. In June 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, France and Greece, as well as some other countries. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws. We are now discussing the situation with the German authorities. At this point, no other formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. In response to the actions of the Commission and national authorities, the Company has launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, some of which are ongoing. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions are being taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A below for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities are formally investigating whether the Company’s affiliates complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions could impact our business results. Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions. Specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. In addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions or if changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which could require the Company to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. In addition, as a U.S. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S. provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. Our Company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our Company’s results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to the current credit crisis. The Company currently generates significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditions resulting from the recent disruption in credit markets poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. If the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers.

All transactions were made in the open market or pursuant to prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company prepaid large financial institutions to deliver shares at future dates in exchange for a discount. The number of shares purchased other than through a publicly announced repurchase plan was 27,062 for the quarter. This includes shares acquired by the Company under various compensation and benefit plans. This table excludes shares withheld from employees to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements on option exercises and other equity-based transactions. The Company administers cashless exercises through an independent, third party broker and does not repurchase stock in connection with cashless exercise. Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission. On August 3, 2007, the Company announced a share repurchase plan. Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, the Board of Directors authorized the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire in open market and/or private transactions $24 to $30 billion of shares of Company common stock over the subsequent three years to be financed by issuing a combination of long-term and short-term debt. Certain purchases were made prior to announcement of the program but are considered purchases against the program. The dollar values listed in this column include commissions to be paid to brokers to execute the transactions.

Fiscal Year 2010 Changes to Global Business Unit (GBU) Structure Effective July 1, 2009, the Company implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of its reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. Presentation of the Global Pharmaceuticals Business as Discontinued Operations Separately, on August 24, 2009, the Company announced an agreement for the sale of its global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott which will be completed at a later date. The pharmaceuticals business has historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business will be presented as discontinued operations and, as such, will be excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The above changes will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2010, starting with the Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2009.

For the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through October 29, 2009, the date of financial statement issuance. Comprehensive Income—Total comprehensive income is comprised primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and defined benefit and other retiree benefit plan activities. Total comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was $4,702 million and $(252) million, respectively. Segment Information – Effective July 1, 2009, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. Following is a summary of segment results. Three Months Ended September 30 Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – Goodwill as of September 30, 2009 is allocated by reportable segment and global business unit as follows (amounts in Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 Beauty, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2009 Grooming, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2009 Health Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Reclassification to held for sale (1) Goodwill, September 30, 2009 Snacks and Pet Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2009 Fabric Care and Home Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2009 Baby Care and Family Care, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Goodwill, September 30, 2009 GOODWILL, beginning of year Acquisitions and divestitures Reclassification to held for sale (1) Goodwill, September 30, 2009 See Note 10 for further details on goodwill reclassification to held for sale. The increase in goodwill from June 30, 2009 is primarily due to currency translation, partially offset by the reclassification of goodwill related to the pharmaceuticals business to assets held for sale. Identifiable intangible assets as of September 30, 2009 are comprised of (amounts in Amortizable intangible assets with determinable lives Intangible assets with indefinite lives Total identifiable intangible assets Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The non-amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of brands. The amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2009, and 2008 was $145 million and $153 million, respectively. Pursuant to applicable accounting guidance for share-based payments, companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. Total share-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30 Total share-based compensation Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. Postretirement Benefits—The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30 Three Months Ended September 30 Expected return on plan assets Amortization of deferred amounts Recognized net actuarial loss Gross benefit cost (credit) Dividends on ESOP preferred stock Net periodic benefit cost (credit) For the year ending June 30, 2010, the expected return on plan assets is 7.1% and 9.3% for pension and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure netting and correlation. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized is immaterial for all periods presented. For additional details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s annual financial statements and footnotes in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. In valuing assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. The fair value of our Level 3 instruments is calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided inputs. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of September 30 and June 30, 2009 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total assets at fair value (2) Liabilities at fair value: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total liabilities at fair value (3) The other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. All assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent assets with the exception of investment securities which are only presented in All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending Level 3 financial assets and liabilities balances for the period June 30 to September 30, 2009. Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in earnings (or changes in net assets) Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in OCI Net purchases, issuances and settlements Transfers in/(out) of Level 3 On July 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of the fair value measurement accounting and disclosure guidance related to non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities subject to this new guidance primarily include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments, long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in business combinations. The adoption of this new guidance did not affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of September 30, 2009 was $289 million. The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $23,880 million and $21,514 million at September 30 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The fair values and amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of, and for the three months ended, September 30, 2009 are as follows: Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (Effective Portion) (1) Three Months Ended September 30 Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Debt on Derivative (Effective Portion) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income (Ineffective Portion) (2) Three Months Ended September Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income (Ineffective Portion) (2) Three Months Ended September Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Notional Amount (Ending Balance) Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized Three Months Ended September Foreign currency contracts The gain or loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and interest expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in The gain or loss on foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in selling, general and administrative expense. During the next 12 months, the amount of the September 30, 2009 OCI balance that will be reclassified to earnings is expected to be immaterial. In addition, the total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on business combinations. The new guidance revises the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price), and post-acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. The Company adopted the new guidance beginning July 1, 2009, and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB also issued new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The new accounting guidance requires that a noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary, and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. The Company retrospectively adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements of the new guidance on July 1, 2009. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Noncontrolling interests of $283 million at June 30, 2009 were reclassified from liabilities to shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net expense for income attributable to the noncontrolling interest totaling $28 million and $21 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected within other non-operating income, net. Net earnings represents net income attributable to the Company’s common shareholders. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe, as detailed in Part 2, Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this 10-Q. We believe these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no significant formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of the above inquiries. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions have been taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they accrued and paid, respectively. As these matters evolve, the Company will recognize the appropriate reserves. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties P&G is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has 50-60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We have tax years open ranging from 1997 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. However, we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $400 million. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Discontinued Operations In August 2009, the Company announced an agreement to sell our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $3.1 billion of cash. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott will acquire our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the 2,300 employees working on the pharmaceuticals business are expected to transfer to Warner Chilcott. The Company expects the transaction to close by the end of the 2009 calendar year, pending necessary regulatory approvals. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Company’s Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of the pharmaceuticals business at September 30, 2009 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of our coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all shares of Folgers common stock, resulting in an increase of treasury stock of $2,466 million. Pursuant to the merger, a Smucker subsidiary Folgers and Folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $2,011 million, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2009. The coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of our away-from-home business, which is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the pharmaceuticals and Three months ended September 30 Earnings from discontinued operations Net earnings from discontinued operations Net earnings from discontinued operations of the pharmaceuticals business for the three months ended September 30, 2009 include an after-tax gain of $121 million on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan. At September 30, 2009, the major components of assets and liabilities held for sale from the pharmaceuticals business were as follows: Prepaid expenses and other assets Property, plant and equipment, net Trademarks and other intangible assets, net Total current assets held for sale Accrued and other liabilities Total current liabilities held for sale Reclassification The Company has reclassified certain amounts in the prior period Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings in accordance with our July 1, 2009 retrospective adoption of new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. See Note 8 for further details. The Company has reclassified certain amounts in the prior period Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to be consistent with the current period presentation. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities, which is consistent with the use of the instruments and their related cash flows. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our purpose is to provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Effective July 1, 2009, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. On August 24, 2009, we announced an agreement for the sale of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott which we expect to complete by the end of calendar 2009. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. The table below provides more information about the components of our GBU structure. Hair Colorants, Shampoos and Conditioners Head & Shoulders, Pantene Hair Colorants, Shampoos and Conditioners Cosmetics, Deodorants, Female Blades and Razors, Personal Cleansing and Skin Care Fine Fragrances and Prestige Skin Care (SK II) Male Blades & Razors and Male Personal Care Products (Deodorants, Face and Shave Products, Hair Care, Personal Cleansing) Electric Hair Removal Devices and Home Appliances Feminine Pads and Tampons Personal Diagnostics, Digestive and Respiratory Health Products Oral Rinses, Toothbrushes and Toothpastes Wet and Dry Pet Food Potato Fabric Care and Home Care Laundry Detergents and Fabric Softeners Air and Fabric Fresheners, Dishwashing Detergents, Hard Surface Cleaners Batteries and Personal Power Devices Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes and Diapers Bath Tissue, Facial Tissue and Paper Towels The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2009 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2009: Net sales declined 6% to $19.8 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 2%. Unit volume declined 3% and organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, decreased 2% versus the comparable prior-year Net earnings from continuing operations declined 3% versus the prior year period as lower net sales and lower levels of minor brand divestiture gains were mostly offset by an increase in operating margin and lower interest expense. Net earnings declined 1% to $3.3 billion for the quarter as the reduction in net earnings from continuing operations was partially offset by earnings from discontinued operations, which included the current period gain on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 3% versus the prior-year period. Diluted net earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to share repurchase activity in the prior fiscal year. Operating cash flow was $4.6 billion, an increase of 32% versus the prior year period. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of operating cash flow less capital expenditures to net earnings, was 121%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K filings. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain key information technology systems. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2009 versus the three months ended September 30, 2008. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended September 30 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales decreased 6% for the quarter to $19.8 billion on a 3% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 7% as many foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Price increases, taken primarily in developing regions to offset local currency devaluations, added 3% to net sales. Positive product mix from disproportionate volume declines in developing regions, which have lower than company average selling prices, contributed 1% to net sales. Volume in developed regions declined low single digits while developing markets were down mid-single digits driven primarily by market contractions in CEEMEA. All reportable segments except Health Care experienced volume declines, led by a double-digit decline in Snacks and Pet Care and a high single-digit decline in Grooming. Organic sales increased 2% led by sequentially improving growth in the Beauty Care and Health Care segments. Net Sales Change Drivers 2009 vs. 2008 (Three Months Ended Sep. 30) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin increased 290 basis points for the quarter to 52.6% of net sales. Price increases, lower commodity and energy costs and manufacturing cost savings added approximately 450 basis points to gross margin and were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, negative product mix and the negative impacts of volume scale deleveraging. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 1% to $6.0 billion due to lower overhead and marketing spending, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses due to higher foreign currency exchange costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up 130 basis points primarily due to the negative scale leveraging impact of reduced sales and an increase in other operating expenses, partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percent of net sales. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased behind the higher foreign currency exchange costs. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased behind media rate savings and a shift in timing of expenditures to later in the fiscal year. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased slightly as productivity improvements and lower restructuring charges were more than offset by sales deleveraging. The higher foreign exchange costs result primarily from our operations in Venezuela. Because of currency restrictions in Venezuela, payments for certain imported goods and services need to be satisfied by exchanging Bolivares Fuertes for U.S. dollars through a parallel exchange mechanism rather than at the more favorable official exchange rate. A reduction in the availability of foreign currency at the official exchange rate resulted in increased costs for exchange transactions executed using the parallel mechanism. Unless official foreign exchange is made more available, we expect these exchange controls to continue negatively impacting our results of operations. In addition, if Venezuela is designated as a high inflation economy and/or there is a devaluation of the official exchange rate, results of operations will be negatively impacted. Interest expense was $287 million for the quarter, a decline of 15% due primarily to lower U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was down $257 million to $23 million mainly due to gains on the sale of minor brands in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on continuing operations declined 30 basis points to 27.7% primarily due to audit settlements, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. Net earnings from continuing operations declined 3% to $3.0 billion mainly due to reduced net sales and lower levels of minor brand divestiture gains, partially offset by an increase in operating margin and lower interest expense. Operating margin expanded primarily due to an increase in gross margin, increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales mainly resulting from higher foreign currency exchange costs. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 1% versus the prior year to $0.97. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $47 million for the quarter to $280 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan, partially offset by the loss of contribution from the Folgers business divested in fiscal 2009. Net earnings from discontinued operations also include the results of operations from the global pharmaceuticals business. Net earnings were down 1% to $3.3 billion during the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.06. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchases in fiscal 2009. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2009 are provided compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2008. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2009 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU Beauty Beauty net sales were down 5% for the quarter to $4.9 billion on a 2% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted net sales by 7%. Price increases, mainly in developing regions to offset local currency devaluations, and positive product mix added 3% and 1% to net sales, respectively. Organic sales grew 2%. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was down 1% mainly due to volume declines in the CEEMEA region and in the more discretionary businesses of Professional Salon and Prestige. Hair Care volume grew low single digits behind initiative-driven growth of Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Rejoice and delivered growth in every region except CEEMEA. Professional Salon volume declined double digits due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and continued market contractions. Prestige volume decreased high single digits primarily due to the continued contraction of the fragrance market, partially offset by double- digit growth of SK II. Female Beauty volume was down mid-single digits primarily due to lower shipments in CEEMEA, share losses on non-strategic personal cleansing brands, lower merchandising and initiative activity in cosmetics and the fiscal 2009 divestiture of Noxzema. Net earnings decreased 1% for the quarter to $777 million as lower net sales and a higher effective tax rate were mostly offset by operating margin expansion. Operating margin increased primarily due to higher gross margin, driven primarily by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings, and a reduction in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange costs. Grooming Grooming net sales in the first fiscal quarter decreased 11% to $1.9 billion on an 8% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 9%. These impacts were partially offset by positive pricing impacts of 6%. Organic sales declined 2%. Volume in Male Blades and Razors declined high single digits behind market contractions and market share declines. Gillette Fusion volume continued to grow but was more than offset by volume declines in legacy shaving systems. Global market share of male blades and razors declined about half a point. Volume in Male Personal Care declined high single digits behind lower shipments of shave preparation products due to market share declines driven by increased competitive promotional activity. Volume in Braun was down double digits mainly due to market contractions, particularly in home and hair care appliances, and market share declines. Net earnings declined 21% versus the prior year period to $351 million primarily driven by lower net sales and reduced operating margin. The contraction of operating margin resulted from higher foreign currency exchange costs, lower gross margin and higher overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, both driven by the negative impacts of scale deleveraging, partially offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales declined 4% to $3.0 billion for the quarter. Unit volume was consistent with the prior year period as growth in developed regions was offset by a decline in developing regions, primarily CEEMEA. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 8%, partially offset by positive pricing impacts of 3% and improved product mix of 1%. Organic sales increased 4%. Personal Health Care volume was in line with the prior year period as growth in diagnostics products was offset by lower shipments of digestive health products in North America and shipment delays in CEEMEA due to a distributor transition. Feminine Care volume declined low single digits mainly due to increased competitive activity in CEEMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia. Global market share of feminine care was down nearly 1 point to about 36%. Oral Care volume was in line with the prior year period as initiative-driven growth in Western Europe and Latin America was offset by market contractions in Asia and CEEMEA. Net earnings increased 9% to $550 million for the first fiscal quarter. The decline in net sales and higher foreign currency exchange costs were more than offset by lower marketing spending as a percentage of net sales, a pricing-driven expansion of gross margin and a receipt from a favorable settlement of a legal dispute. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales were down 6% for the quarter to $755 million on a 10% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Price increases to offset increased commodity costs and currency devaluations contributed 6% to net sales. Improved product mix added 1% to net sales due to relatively better volume results in Pet Care, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales declined 3% due to a decline in Snacks, partially offset by growth in Pet Care. Volume in Snacks decreased double digits due to lower merchandising activity in North America following the Super Stacks initiative and market contractions in CEEMEA. Volume in Pet Care was down low single digits mainly due to the contraction of the premium nutrition category following price increases, partially offset by the impact of new product initiatives launched in previous quarters. Net earnings were up 35% in the first quarter to $74 million behind gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased mainly due to price increases, formulation and packaging cost savings and commodity cost reductions in Pet Care. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales decreased 5% to $6.1 billion for the quarter on a 2% decline in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 7%, while positive pricing and product mix improved net sales by 3% and 1%, respectively. Organic sales grew 2%. Fabric Care volume was down low single digits due to trade inventory reductions in North America and global market share declines, partially offset by the new product launches and growth in Western Europe behind incremental merchandising activities. Global market share of fabric care declined less than 1 point. Home Care volume grew mid-single digits primarily due to new initiative launches in North America and Western Europe. Global market share of home care increased over half a point. Batteries volume declined mid-single digits due to market contractions, market share declines and trade inventory reductions. Global market share of general purpose batteries declined about 1 point. Net earnings grew 22% to $1.0 billion behind gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by lower net sales and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased primarily due to the impact of price increases taken in the previous fiscal year, lower commodity costs and manufacturing and formulation cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up due to an increase in currency exchange costs and higher overhead and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales declined 5% in the first fiscal quarter to $3.6 billion on a 1% decline in unit volume. Price increases, primarily taken in developing regions to offset local currency devaluations, added 2% to net sales. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%. Organic sales grew 1%. Baby Care volume increased low single digits behind new initiative launches in Western Europe including the expansion of Pampers Simply Dry and market growth in Asia and Western Europe. Family Care volume was down mid-single digits due to lower shipments of Charmin primarily driven by trade inventory reductions and market share losses due to a shift in timing of merchandising activity. Net earnings increased 8% to $557 million as gross margin expansion more than offset lower net sales, higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a higher tax rate. Gross margin increased mainly behind the impact of price increases taken in previous periods, lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange costs and higher overhead spending. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to For the Corporate segment, net expenses from continuing operations increased $277 million to $291 million for the quarter. The increase in net expenses was driven primarily by higher divestiture gains and hedging impacts in the prior year period and foreign currency transaction losses in the current period. These were partially offset by lower current period net interest expense and a decrease in overhead spending which includes a reduction in restructuring charges. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities for the quarter increased 32% versus the comparable prior year period to $4.6 billion. The combination of net earnings and non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on the sale of businesses) provided $3.9 billion of operating cash compared to $4.2 billion in the prior year period. A decrease in working capital contributed $209 million to operating cash flow primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities behind higher taxes payable, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable levels increased during the fiscal first quarter primarily due to higher net sales versus the June quarter but declined versus the comparable prior year period mainly due to lower net sales versus the prior year period and improved collection efforts. Inventory balances consumed less cash in the current period due to improving commodity costs trends and better matching of production to shipment volume. Investing Activities Investing activities in the first fiscal quarter used $378 million. Cash consumed by investing activities decreased 8% versus the prior year period mainly due to lower capital spending, partially offset by lower net cash from acquisition and divestiture activities. Capital expenditures were $552 million for the quarter or 2.8% of net sales. Proceeds from asset sales generated $209 million in cash primarily from the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan. Financing Activities Cash used to fund financing activities was up 62% versus the prior year period to $2.8 billion for the quarter. The increase versus the prior year resulted mainly from the retirement of debt, partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock purchases. Current year net repayments of debt used $1.6 billion, while dividends to shareholders used $1.3 billion. As of September 30, 2009, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.2 billion, driven by our short-term debt position. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share buyback programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which despite the credit crisis have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the July—September quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2009. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on pages 47-48, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 58-61 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters and taxes. The Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. In 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. Also in 2008, authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, France and Greece, as well as some other countries. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. At this point, no formal claims have been made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with the French, European Commission or UK inquiries. The remaining matters also are in various stages of the investigatory process. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions have been taken. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities are formally investigating whether the Company’s affiliates complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). For a discussion of the Company’s risk factors, please refer to Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid per Share (2) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (3) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under our Share Repurchase Program ($ in of shares purchased was 6,030,211 for the quarter. All transactions were made in the open market or pursuant to prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company prepays large financial institutions to deliver shares at future dates in exchange for a discount. The number of shares purchased other than through a publicly announced repurchase plan was 6,030,211 for the quarter.

Also, as disclosed in a Form 8-K dated August 24, 2009, the Company announced an agreement for the sale of its global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (“Warner Chilcott”). This Form 8-K provides pro forma historical total company and segment results for the three months ended December 31, 2008, reflecting the change in the reporting structure of the Company and the presentation of the Company’s pharmaceuticals business as discontinued operations. This information in no way revises or restates the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Shareholder’s Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. Fiscal Year 2010 Changes to Global Business Unit (GBU) Structure Effective July 1, 2009, the Company implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of its reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. Presentation of the Global Pharmaceuticals Business as Discontinued Operations On October 30, 2009, the Company sold its global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott for $2.9 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired the Company’s portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business has historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The above changes are being reflected in the consolidated financial statements and segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2010, starting with the Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2009.

Going forward, the devaluation of the official rate has reduced the differential between the official and parallel exchange rate and is therefore expected to reduce the incremental cost of exchanging currencies through securities transactions in the parallel market. However, at this time, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela and the availability of official foreign exchange rate U.S. dollars. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2009 versus the six months ended December 31, 2008. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Six Months Ended December 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales were in line with the prior year period at $40.8 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Price increases, taken primarily in developing regions to offset local currency devaluations, added 2% to net sales. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3% as many foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in the first fiscal quarter. Volume was up low single digits in both developed and developing regions, led by mid-single–digits growth in Asia. Volume growth for the reportable segments was mixed, with low to mid-single-digit increases in the Fabric Care and Home Care, Baby Care and Family Care and Health Care segments, partially offset by mid-single-digit declines in the Grooming and Snacks and Pet Care segments. Organic sales increased 3% led by mid-single-digits growth in the Household Care GBU. Net Sales Change Drivers 2009 vs. 2008 (Six Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin increased 310 basis points versus the comparable prior year period to 53.1% of net sales. Lower commodity and energy costs increased gross margin by approximately 170 basis points. Gross margin also benefited from manufacturing cost savings and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative product and geographic mix. Total SG&A increased 5% to $12.6 billion due to higher other operating expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. Other operating expenses increased mainly due to Venezuela-related foreign currency exchange costs of $546 million and a charge for potential competition law fines of $267 million. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 150 basis points to 30.8% behind a 180 basis point increase in other operating expenses as a percentage of sales, driven by the aforementioned currency exchange costs and charges for competition law fines, partially offset by a decrease in overhead spending as a percentage of net sales, driven by productivity improvements and lower restructuring spending. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was consistent with the prior year period as additional marketing investments were offset by media rate savings. Interest expense was down $182 million versus the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 26% due primarily to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a reduction in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income declined $271 million to $76 million mainly due to gains on the sale of minor brands in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 190 basis points to 28.7% primarily due to lower audit settlements and foreign tax credits and the non-deductibility of the charge for potential competition law fines. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 4% to $6.2 billion mainly due to an increase in operating margin, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. Operating margin expanded primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% versus the prior year period to $1.98. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $634 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to lower gains on the sale of discontinued operations. In the current year, we had a gain of $1.5 billion from the sale of the global pharmaceuticals business, as compared to the $2.0 billion prior year gain on the sale of the Folgers coffee business. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the loss of contribution from the global pharmaceuticals business which was divested at the end of October 2009. Net earnings declined 5% versus the prior year period to $8.0 billion behind a decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share were down 2% to $2.56. Earnings per share growth rates differed from net earnings growth rates due to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2009 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2009 are provided compared to the same three and six month period ended December 31, 2008. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2009 versus the comparable prior year periods (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2009 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Six Months Ended December 31, 2009 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU Beauty Beauty net sales increased 7% in the second fiscal quarter to $5.2 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Organic sales increased 4% versus the prior year period. Price increases, primarily in developing regions to offset currency impacts, and favorable foreign exchange added 2% and 3%, respectively, to net sales growth. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was up 3% behind mid-single-digit growth in developing regions, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in developed regions. Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits mainly due to double-digit growth in Asia driven by both market and share growth. Volume in Female Beauty increased low single digits primarily due to higher shipments of female skin care and personal cleansing products in developing regions. Volume in Salon Professional was down double digits due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and continued market contractions. Volume in Prestige decreased low single digits as continued contraction of the fragrance market was mostly offset by trade inventory reductions in the prior year period. Net earnings were up 7% versus the prior year period to $876 million on higher net sales and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Gross margin expansion, primarily due to price increases and manufacturing cost savings, was partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of sales behind increased marketing spending and higher foreign currency exchange costs. Beauty net sales increased 1% fiscal year to date to $10.1 billion. Organic sales increased 3%. Unit volume was consistent with the prior year period, while organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, increased 1% driven by growth in Hair Care. Pricing increases, primarily taken in developing regions to offset currency devaluations, added 3% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Hair Care volume grew low single digits behind growth of Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Rejoice primarily in Asia and Latin America. Female Beauty volume was down low single digits due to lower shipments of cosmetics behind the discontinuation of Max Factor in North America and lower merchandising and initiative activity, the fiscal 2009 divestiture of Noxzema and market share losses on non-strategic personal cleansing brands. Salon Professional volume declined double digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and continued market contractions. Prestige volume declined mid-single digits due to continued contraction of the fragrance market. Net earnings grew 3% fiscal year to date to $1.7 billion behind operating margin expansion and net sales growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Operating margin increased due to higher gross margin driven by price increases and manufacturing costs savings. Gross margin expansion was partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to higher foreign currency exchange costs and increased marketing spending. Grooming Grooming net sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion for the quarter on a 2% decline in unit volume. Organic sales were consistent with the prior year period. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 3% to net sales. Price increases, taken mainly in developing regions to offset currency impacts, added 4% to net sales for the quarter. Negative mix impacts reduced net sales by 2% as volume declines disproportionately affected developed regions and premium shaving systems, both of which have higher than segment average selling prices. Male Blades and Razors volume was down low single digits as market contractions and market share losses in developed regions were partially offset by initiative-driven growth in developing regions. Volume declines in premium shaving systems were mostly offset by growth in lower priced systems and disposables. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down nearly 2 points to about 70%. Male Personal Care volume declined high single digits behind increased competitive promotional activity on shave preparation products and distribution declines on Tag deodorants. Braun volume decreased low single digits behind a double-digit decline in developing regions mainly due to market contractions. Global market share of the dry shaving category was up about half a point to 33%. Net earnings increased 10% to $433 million for the quarter due to net sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Gross margin increased mainly due to price increases and lower commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up mainly due to higher foreign currency exchange costs, mostly offset by overhead spending reductions and marketing spending efficiencies. Grooming net sales were down 4% to $4.0 billion fiscal year to date on a 5% decline in unit volume. Organic sales declined 1%. Price increases, taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations and across premium shaving systems, added 5% to net sales. Product mix had a negative 1% impact on net sales due to disproportionate volume decline of premium shaving systems, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Volume in Blades and Razors was down mid-single digits mainly due to market contractions and market share losses in developed regions. A mid-single-digits increase of Gillette Fusion volume was more than offset by the continued double-digit decline of Mach3 volume. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down nearly 2 points to 70%. Volume in Male Personal Care declined high single digits primarily behind increased competitive promotional activity on shave preparation products and distribution declines on Tag deodorants. Volume in Braun was down high single digits due mostly to market contractions, particularly in home and hair care appliances. Global market share of the dry shaving category was down about half a point to approximately 34%. Net earnings were $784 million fiscal year to date, a decrease of 6% versus the comparable prior year period behind operating margin contraction and net sales decline. Operating margin decreased due to higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in gross margin due to price increases and lower commodity costs. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven by higher foreign currency exchange costs, partially offset by lower marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales were up 5% for the quarter to $3.1 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Organic sales grew 2%. Favorable foreign exchange and positive pricing impacts added 3% and 1%, respectively to net sales growth. These impacts were partially offset by a 2% negative mix impact resulting from disproportionate growth in developing regions and unfavorable product mix. Volume in developing regions grew high single digits, while developed regions grew low single digits. Personal Health Care volume increased mid-single digits behind double-digit growth of Vicks due to higher cold and flu levels and double-digit growth of diagnostics products, partially offset by a double-digit decline of Prilosec OTC in North America due to increased competitive activity. Feminine Care volume was up low single digits due mainly to growth in the CEEMEA and Asia regions, partially offset by market share losses in Latin America following price increases. Global market share of the feminine care category was down about 1 point to 35%. Oral Care volume grew mid-single digits behind initiative-driven growth in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia and trade inventory reductions in the base period, partially offset by a decline in North America. Net earnings grew 8% in the quarter to $534 million on higher net sales and operating margin expansion. Gross margin increased mainly due to price increases, lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange costs and higher overhead and marketing spending to fund investments in business growth. Health Care net sales fiscal year to date were consistent with the prior year period at $6.1 billion. Organic sales increased 3%. Unit volume increased 1% driven by growth of Personal Health Care and Oral Care. Price increases, taken mainly in developing regions to offset currency devaluations, added 2% to net sales. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Personal Health Care volume was up low singles digits driven by mid-single-digit growth of Vicks due to higher cold and flu levels and double-digit growth of diagnostic products, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline of Prilosec OTC in North America due to increased competitive activity. Oral Care volume increased low single digits behind initiative activity in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia. Feminine Care volume was in line with the prior year period as growth of Always and Naturella was offset by lower shipments of Tampax. Global market share of the feminine care category was down about 1 point to 35%. Net earnings were $1.1 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of 9% versus the prior year period behind operating margin expansion. Operating margin was up due to higher gross margin and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin expanded behind price increases, lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined mainly due to lower marketing spending, partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange costs and overhead spending. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales increased 6% to $835 million for the quarter on a 1% increase in unit volume. Organic sales increased 3%. The carryover impact of pricing to recover higher commodity costs added 5% to net sales. This was partially offset by negative mix impacts of 2% driven by the discontinuation of premium snack products which had higher than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 2% to net sales growth. Volume in Snacks declined low single digits driven by lower merchandising activity in North America and the discontinuation of some premium snack products. Volume in Pet Care increased mid-single digits behind continued success of product initiatives and increased promotional activity. Net earnings increased 56% versus the prior year period to $98 million behind gross margin expansion, net sales growth and a lower tax rate due to geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to price increases, lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased mainly due to higher marketing spending. Snacks and Pet Care net sales decreased 1% fiscal year to date to $1.6 billion on a 5% decline in unit volume. Organic sales were consistent with the prior year period. Price increases, taken primarily to offset high commodity costs, added 5% to net sales. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%.

Volume in Pet Care increased low single digits due to continued success of product initiatives and increased promotional activity. Net earnings increased 46% to $172 million fiscal year to date behind higher operating margins and a lower tax rate. Operating margin expanded mainly due to higher gross margin driven by price increases, commodity cost declines and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to increased marketing and HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales grew 9% in the second fiscal quarter to $6.3 billion on an 8% increase in unit volume.

All major brands contributed to volume growth for the segment. Fabric Care volume increased high single digits mainly due to a low base period, which included trade inventory reductions, and initiative-driven growth in the current period. Volume growth was broad-based in Fabric Care with growth in all regions. Home Care volume grew double digits due to initiative activity in all regions, market growth in North America and CEEMEA and trade inventory reductions in the prior year period. Batteries volume increased low single digits due to market growth in developing regions and trade inventory reductions in the prior year period. Net earnings grew 47% to $965 million primarily due to operating margin expansion, net sales growth and lower tax rate. Operating margin expanded behind improved gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased behind manufacturing cost savings and lower commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales driven by scale leverage. Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 1% to $12.4 billion fiscal year to date on a 3% increase in unit volume. Organic sales grew 4%. Price increases added 1% to net sales growth as the carry over impact of prior period price increases taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations was partially offset by more recent price reductions to improve consumer value. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Fabric Care volume increased low single digits behind new product launches and growth in Western Europe from incremental merchandising activity, partially offset by market share loss. Global market share of the fabric care category was down about 1 point. Home Care volume increased high single digits mainly due to new product launches and market growth. Global market share of the home care category was up half a point to 17%. Batteries volume was down low single digits primarily due to market share losses in North America and Western Europe. Global market share of the general purpose batteries category was down over half a point to about 27%. Net earnings increased 33% to $2.0 billion due to increased operating margin, a lower tax rate and higher net sales. Operating margin expanded due to higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to lower commodity costs, price increases and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing spending and increased foreign currency exchange costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 10% to $3.8 billion for the quarter on 10% volume growth. Organic sales grew 8%. Negative mix impacts due to a shift toward larger count packages, which have lower than segment average selling prices, reduced net sales by 2%. Favorable foreign exchange added 2% to net sales growth. Baby Care volume was up high single digits behind incremental initiative activity and merchandising support, as well as market growth. Family Care volume grew double digits due to initiatives launched in the previous quarter and incremental merchandising activity. U.S. all-outlet value share of the family care category increased over 1%. Net earnings were up 39% for the quarter to $579 million on gross margin expansion and net sales growth, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased behind lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales were up due to higher foreign currency exchange costs and higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Baby Care and Family Care net sales grew 2% to $7.4 billion fiscal year to date on 4% volume growth. Organic sales increased 5%. Price increases added 1% to net sales growth as the carryover impact of price increases taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations was partially offset by more recent price reductions to improve consumer value. Negative product mix reduced net sales by 1%. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Volume in Baby Care increased mid-single digits behind incremental initiative activity and merchandising support, as well as market growth. Volume in Family Care grew mid-single digits due to market growth and volume share gains driven by increased merchandising and initiative activity. Family Care U.S. value share was up nearly half a point to about 33%. Net earnings increased 22% to $1.1 billion behind operating margin expansion and net sales growth. Operating margin expansion was driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased behind lower commodity costs, price increases and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up due to higher foreign currency exchange costs, increased overhead spending and incremental marketing investments. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. For the Corporate segment, net expenses from continuing operations increased $300 million to $336 million for the quarter. The increase in net expenses was driven primarily by the $267 million charge for potential competition law fines, higher foreign currency exchange costs and higher net tax costs due to the impacts of tax adjustments required to reconcile the statutory rates reflected in the business segments to the overall Company effective tax rate, partially offset by lower interest expense. Fiscal year to date, net expenses from continuing operations increased $577 million. The increase was primarily due to the charge for potential competition law fines, higher foreign currency exchange costs, higher net tax costs due to the impact of tax adjustments required to reconcile the statutory rates reflected in the business segments to the overall Company effective tax rate and higher prior period divestiture gains, partially offset by lower interest expense. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated $7.8 billion of cash from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period, an increase of 39% versus the comparable prior year period mainly due to changes in working capital required to support the business, partially offset by lower net earnings. Working capital reductions versus June contributed $847 million to operating cash flow primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities behind higher current period accruals and an increase in taxes payable, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable levels increased primarily due to higher net sales versus the June quarter. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed $285 million to operating cash flow. Investing Activities Our investing activities generated cash of $1.6 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of $2.3 billion versus the prior year period mainly due to higher proceeds from divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales increased $2.0 billion due to receipts from the sales of the global pharmaceuticals business, including Actonel in Japan, partially offset by receipts in the prior year period related to the Folgers, Thermacare and other minor brand divestitures. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion fiscal year to date or 3.1% of net sales. Acquisitions consumed $70 million of cash primarily to fund the purchase of MDVIP, a physicians’ network focused on preventative medicine. Financing Activities We used $10.3 billion fiscal year to date to fund financing activities. This represents an increase of $8.0 billion versus the prior year period driven mainly by the retirement of debt, partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock purchases. Current year net repayments of debt used $6.6 billion, while dividends to shareholders increased to $2.7 billion. We resumed our share repurchase program during the second fiscal quarter and expect to repurchase about $5 billion during fiscal 2010. As of December 31, 2009, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.9 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the October - December quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in Free Cash Flow Productivity",4936

On April 18, 2010, the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company (the “Company”) approved and adopted a series of amendments to the Company’s Code of Regulations (the “Regulations”) effective immediately.

Pursuant to this amendment, if a shareholder wishes to present either (1) a proposal relating to director nominations or (2) a proposal relating to a matter other than director nominations, other than a proposal offered pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the shareholder must comply with the procedures contained in Article II, Section 8 of the amended Regulations. These procedures include timely notice to the Company Secretary of such proposal, specific requirements as to the form of notice and content of the proposal, and detailed disclosures regarding the shareholder’s ownership and voting interests in Company securities as well as descriptions of all agreements, arrangements and understandings betwe en the proposing shareholder and other shareholders.

For a notice to be timely with respect to any other business, a proposal must be received by the Company Secretary no later than 90 days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting and no earlier than 240 days prior to that date. The advance notice provision sets different deadlines if an annual meeting is scheduled for more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the one year anniversary date of the previous year’s annual meeting. The amended Regulations also establish procedures for special meetings of shareholders. Indemnification Provision The Board amended Article III, Section 8 to address Company indemnification of all employees. In addition, the Board revised the standards for Company indemnification to be more consistent with Ohio General Corporation Law. Administrative / Ministerial Provisions The Board approved and adopted amendments to a number of other provisions to update and modernize the Regulations, including: Article I – Eliminated reference to Company seal Article II – Authorized “virtual” shareholder meetings, and enhanced flexibility for setting the date for the annual meeting, providing notice to shareholders and establishing the order of business for meetings Article III – Increased flexibility for setting and providing notice for regular Board meetings Article IV – Updated officer titles and procedures for officer elections, terms and removals Article V – Updated officer titles and duties The foregoing descriptions of the Regulations are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual Code of Regulations of The Procter & Gamble Company, which is filed as Exhibit 3.ii to this Form 8-K and is hereby incorporate by reference.

The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2010 are not necessarily indicative of annual results. Comprehensive Income - Total comprehensive income is comprised primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and defined benefit and other retiree benefit plan activities. Total comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 was $772 million and $504 million, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, total comprehensive income was $9,860 million and $2,896 million, respectively. Segment Information - Effective July 1, 2009, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. As discussed in Note 10, certain divested businesses are presented as discontinued operations and are excluded from segment results for all periods presented. Following is a summary of segment results.

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure netting and correlation. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized is immaterial for all periods presented. For additional details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as updated by the Company’s Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2010. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. In valuing assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. The fair value of our Level 3 instruments is calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided inputs. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2009 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Other foreign currency instruments Total assets at fair value Liabilities at fair value: Other foreign currency instruments Total liabilities at fair value The other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. All derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets, and investment securities are presented in other All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other non-current liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending Level 3 financial assets and liabilities balances for the period June 30, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in earnings (or changes in net assets) Total gains or (losses) (realized/unrealized) included in OCI Net purchases, issuances and settlements Transfers in/(out) of Level 3 Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of March 31, 2010 was $270 million. The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. On July 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of the fair value measurement accounting and disclosure guidance related to non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities subject to this new guidance primarily include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments, long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in business combinations. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the nine months ended March 31, 2010. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $24,309 million and $21,514 million at March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The fair values and amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of, and for the three and nine-month periods ended, March 31, 2010 are as follows: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Gain (Loss) Recognized in Debt on Derivatives (Effective Portion) Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships that is reclassified from accumulated OCI into income is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and interest expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in The gain or loss on foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in selling, general and administrative expense. During the next 12 months, the amount of the March 31, 2010 OCI balance that will be reclassified to earnings is expected to be immaterial. In addition, the total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on business combinations. The new guidance revises the method of accounting for a number of aspects of business combinations including acquisition costs, contingencies (including contingent assets, contingent liabilities and contingent purchase price) and post-acquisition exit activities of acquired businesses. The Company adopted the new guidance beginning July 1, 2009, and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB also issued new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The new accounting guidance requires that a noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. The Company retrospectively adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements of the new guidance on July 1, 2009. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Noncontrolling interests of $283 million at June 30, 2009 were reclassified from non-current liabilities to shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net expense for income attributable to the noncontrolling interest totaling $32 million and $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $93 million and $61 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected within other non-operating income, net. Net earnings represent net income attributable to the Company’s common shareholders. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe, as detailed in Part 2, Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this 10-Q. We believe these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Three countries in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The Company will have the opportunity to respond to these complaints. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of these complaints, the Company has taken appropriate reserves totaling $279 million fiscal year to date for potential fines for competition law violations. The remaining matters are in various stages of the investigatory process. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs in excess of amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. In other industries, these fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations, and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties P&G is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has 50 – 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We have tax years open ranging from 1997 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. However, we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and related reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statute of limitations. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $500 million. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Discontinued Operations In October 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion of cash, net of assumed and transferred liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the employees working on the pharmaceuticals business were transferred to Warner Chilcott. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $1,464 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2010. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Company’s Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. In November 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of our coffee business through the merger of its Folgers coffee subsidiary into The J.M. Smucker Company (Smucker) in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the merger, 38.7 million shares of common stock of the Company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all shares of Folgers common stock, resulting in an increase of treasury stock of $2,466 million. Pursuant to the merger, a Smucker subsidiary merged with and into Folgers and Folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $2,011 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2009. The coffee business had historically been part of the Company’s Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care reportable segment, as well as the coffee portion of our away-from-home business, which was included in the Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of Folgers are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the pharmaceuticals and coffee businesses: Three months ended March 31 Earnings from discontinued operations Net earnings from discontinued operations Nine months ended March 31 Earnings from discontinued operations Gain on sale of discontinued operations Income tax benefit (expense) on sale Net earnings from discontinued operations The net gain on the sale of the pharmaceuticals business for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2010 includes an after-tax gain of $121 million on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 Results of Operations – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2010 Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, core EPS (earnings per share), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our purpose is to provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Effective July 1, 2009, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. On October 30, 2009, we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The table below provides more information about the components of our GBU structure. Hair Colorants, Shampoos and Conditioners Head & Shoulders, Pantene Hair Colorants, Shampoos and Conditioners Cosmetics, Deodorants, Female Blades and Razors, Personal Cleansing and Skin Care Fine Fragrances and Prestige Skin Care (SK II) Male Blades & Razors and Male Personal Care Products (Deodorants, Face and Shave Products, Hair Care, Personal Cleansing) Electric Hair Removal Devices and Home Appliances Feminine Pads and Tampons Personal Diagnostics, Digestive and Respiratory Health Products Oral Rinses, Toothbrushes and Toothpastes Fabric Care and Home Care Laundry Detergents and Fabric Softeners Air and Fabric Fresheners, Dishwashing Detergents, Hard Surface Cleaners Batteries and Personal Power Devices Baby Care and Family Care Bath Tissue, Facial Tissue and Paper Towels The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2010 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2010 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2010: Net sales increased 2% versus the comparable prior year period to $60.0 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 3%. Unit volume was up 3% versus the prior year period primarily behind growth in the Household Care GBU. Net earnings from continuing operations were $8.8 billion, an increase of 5% versus the prior year period due to net sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Net earnings were $10.6 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year period due to lower current period gains on the sale of discontinued operations. Diluted net earnings per share declined 2% versus the prior year period to $3.39, while diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $2.82. Growth rates on a per share basis differ from those of net earnings due to share repurchase activity. Core EPS, which excludes certain tax, legal and restructuring charges, was $2.96, up 10%. Operating cash flow increased $2.8 billion versus the prior year period to $12.8 billion. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $10.8 billion fiscal year to date. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 102%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K filings. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain key information technology systems. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2010 versus the three months ended March 31, 2009. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended March 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations ) Net sales increased 7% to $19.2 billion for the January - March quarter on a 7% increase in unit volume. Volume growth was broad-based with growth in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in developing regions. Five of the six business segments contributed to volume growth, led by double-digit growth in the Fabric Care and Home Care and the Baby Care and Family Care segments. Volume in the Beauty, Grooming and Health Care segments was up mid-single digits, while volume in the Snacks and Pet Care segment declined mid-single digits. Price decreases lowered net sales by 1% behind current period pricing investments to improve consumer value, partially offset by the impact of prior period increases taken in developing regions to offset currency devaluations. Negative mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange added 3% to net sales growth as key foreign currencies strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth was 4% driven by a unit volume growth, partially offset by the impact of price decreases and negative mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2010 vs. 2009 (Three Months with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin increased 290 basis points to 51.9% of net sales for the quarter. Manufacturing cost savings increased gross margin by approximately 190 basis points. Gross margin was also positively impacted by lower commodity and energy costs which contributed approximately 90 basis points of improvement. The benefit of volume scale leverage was offset by unfavorable product mix and lower pricing. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $6.0 billion, up 15% versus the prior year period due to higher marketing and overhead spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 210 basis points due primarily to higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased across all reportable segments behind additional investments to support business growth, partially offset by media rate savings. Interest expense was $223 million for the quarter, down $114 million versus the prior year period primarily due to a reduction in debt outstanding and lower interest rates on floating rate debt. Other non-operating income declined $17 million mainly due to gains on the sale of minor brands in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 600 basis points to 31.3% primarily due to a $152 million charge for recently enacted legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the United States. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 6% for the quarter to $2.6 billion driven by margin expansion and net sales growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Operating margin expanded primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales driven by increased marketing spending. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.83, up 6% versus the comparable prior year period. Net earnings from discontinued operations declined $184 million for the quarter primarily due to the loss of contribution from the global pharmaceuticals business which was divested at the end of October 2009. Net earnings decreased 1% for the quarter to $2.6 billion behind a decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share were down 1% to $0.83. Core EPS, which is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding current period charges for pending European legal matters and recently enacted legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the United States and incremental restructuring charges incurred in the prior period to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture, was up 10% to $0.89 for the quarter. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2010 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2009. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Nine Months Ended March 31 Selling, General & Administrative Expense Other Non-operating Income, Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net Earnings From Discontinued Operations Effective Tax Rate – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Basic Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Continuing Operations Diluted Net Earnings – Discontinued Operations Average Diluted Shares Outstanding Comparisons as a % of Net Sales Selling, General & Administrative Expense Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Net sales increased 2% versus the prior year period to $60.0 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and mid-single digits in developing regions. All geographic regions contributed to volume growth, led by mid-single–digits growth in Asia. Volume growth for the reportable segments was mixed, with low to mid-single-digit increases in the Fabric Care and Home Care, Baby Care and Family Care, Beauty and Health Care segments, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Snacks and Pet Care segment and a low single-digit decline in the Grooming segment. Price increases added 1% to net sales as increases taken primarily in developing regions to offset local currency devaluations were partially offset by more recent price reductions to improve consumer value. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1% as many foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in the first fiscal quarter. Mix reduced net sales by 1% behind disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than Company average selling prices, and relatively weaker shipments of Professional Salon, Prestige, Personal Health Care and Pet Care, which have higher than Company average selling prices. Organic sales were up 3% led by mid-single-digits growth across the Net Sales Change Drivers 2010 vs. 2009 (Nine Months Ended Volume excluding Acquisitions Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin increased 310 basis points versus the comparable prior year period to 52.8% of net sales. The combination of manufacturing cost savings and lower commodity and energy costs delivered approximately 300 basis points of the gross margin expansion. Gross margin also benefited from price increases and volume scale leverage, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative product and geographic mix. Total SG&A increased 8% to $18.6 billion due primarily to higher marketing and other operating expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points to 31.0% behind a 120 basis point increase in other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and higher marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Other operating expenses increased mainly due to Venezuela-related foreign currency exchange costs of $541 million (see further discussion in the following paragraph) and charges for potential competition law fines of $279 million. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was up as additional marketing investments were partially offset by media rate savings. Because of currency restrictions in Venezuela, payments for certain imported goods and services are satisfied by exchanging Bolivares fuertes for U.S. dollars through securities transactions in the parallel market rather than at the more favorable official exchange rate. At the discretion of management, these securities transactions can be utilized to manage exposure to currency movements on local cash balances. A reduction in the availability of foreign currency at the official exchange rate resulted in increased costs for exchange transactions executed using securities transactions in the parallel market during the current year. Interest expense was down $296 million versus the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 29% due primarily to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a reduction in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income declined $288 million to $93 million mainly due to the impact of prior year gains on the sale of minor brands. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 320 basis points to 29.5% primarily due to a charge for recently enacted legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the United States, lower current period audit settlements and foreign tax credits and the non-deductibility of the aforementioned charge for potential competition law fines. Net earnings from continuing operations were $8.8 billion, an increase of 5% versus the prior year period due mainly to operating margin expansion and net sales growth, partially offset by a tax rate increase. Operating margin was up due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $2.82. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $818 million to $1.8 billion due to lower gains on the sale of discontinued operations and a loss of contribution from the global pharmaceuticals business divested in October 2009. In the current year, we had a gain of $1.5 billion from the sale of the global pharmaceuticals business, as compared to the $2.0 billion prior year gain on the sale of the Folgers coffee business. Net earnings were down 4% versus the prior year period to $10.6 billion due to the decline in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share were down 2% to $3.39. Earnings per share growth rates differed from net earnings growth rates due to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases. Core EPS, which is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding current period charges for pending European legal matters and recently enacted legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the United States and the impact of incremental restructuring charges incurred in the prior period to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture, was up 10% to $2.96 fiscal year to date. Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts As of January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, beginning January 1, 2010, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Beginning in our third fiscal quarter, currency remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries’ financial statements and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses will be reflected in earnings. Through December 31, 2009 (prior to being designated as highly inflationary), translation adjustments were reflected in Shareholders’ Equity as part of other comprehensive income. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency (Bolivar fuerte) relative to the U.S. dollar. The official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential, such as food and medicine, changed from 2.15 to 2.6, while payments for other non-essential goods moved to an exchange rate of 4.3. Some of our imported products fall into the essential classification and qualify for the 2.6 rate. However, our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our consolidated financial statements at the 4.3 rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. The remeasurement of our local balance sheets in the third fiscal quarter to reflect the impact of the devaluation did not materially impact our results. There will also be an ongoing impact related to measuring our income statement at the new exchange rates. Moving from the 2.15 rate to 4.3 will reduce future total company reported sales by less than 2% on a going basis. For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, the impact was approximately 1%. This does not impact our organic sales growth rate, which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. Versus our existing business plans, the exchange rate change reduced our reported earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in the third fiscal quarter and is expected to reduce fourth quarter results by about $0.03 per share. This impact is net of the impact of devaluation on Venezuela-related foreign currency exchange costs. Going forward, the devaluation of the official rate has reduced the differential between the official and parallel exchange rate and is therefore expected to reduce the incremental cost of exchanging currencies through securities transactions in the parallel market. Over time, we intend to restore the sales and profit levels achieved prior to the devaluation. However, our ability to do so will be impacted by several factors, including the company’s ability to take actions to mitigate the effect of the devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2010 are provided compared to the same three and nine month period ended March 31, 2009. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2010 versus the comparable prior year periods (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Nine Months Ended March 31, 2010 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Beauty Beauty net sales increased 6% to $4.6 billion for the quarter on unit volume growth of 4%. Organic sales increased 2%. Price reductions, due mainly to strengthened trade programs in the CEEMEA region and in North American Hair Care to support innovation and maintain competitive consumer value, lowered net sales growth by 1%. Negative geographic mix reduced net sales by 1% due mainly to the disproportionate growth in developing regions where selling prices are below the segment average. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 4% to net sales growth. Volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in developing regions. Developed region volume was down low single digits. Hair Care volume was up mid-single digits driven by double-digit growth in developing regions, partially offset by low- single digit decline in developed regions. Overall hair care growth was driven by initiative activity and market size expansion with all major Hair Care brands contributing to volume growth. Market share of the global hair care category declined about half a point. Female Beauty volume grew mid-single digits primarily due to a double-digit increase in shipments of female skin care products driven by the Olay Natural White initiative in Asia. Salon Professional volume declined high single digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses, while organic volume declined mid-single digits primarily due to continued market contractions. Prestige volume increased mid-single digits as the impact of trade inventory reductions in the prior year period were partially offset by continued contraction of the fragrance market in the current year. Net earnings were $562 million, up 2% behind higher net sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by lower operating margin and a minor brand divestiture gain in the prior year period. Operating margin contracted as a higher gross margin behind lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings was more than offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to increased marketing investments. Beauty net sales increased 2% fiscal year to date to $14.8 billion on unit volume growth of 1%. Organic sales were up 3% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Pricing increases added 1% to net sales growth as price increases taken early in the fiscal year in developing regions to offset currency devaluations more than offset the more recent price reductions in Hair Care. Hair Care volume grew low single digits, while organic volume grew mid-single digits behind growth of Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Rejoice primarily in Asia and Latin America. Global share of the hair care market was down less than half a point to 22%. Female Beauty volume was in line with the prior year period as higher shipments of female skin care and personal cleansing products in developing regions were offset by the discontinuation of Max Factor in North America, the fiscal 2009 divestiture of Noxzema and market share losses on non-strategic personal cleansing brands in developed regions. Salon Professional volume was down double digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and continued market contractions. Prestige volume declined low single digits due to continued contraction of the fragrance market. Net earnings grew 3% fiscal year to date to $2.2 billion driven by net sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by divestiture gains in the prior period and a higher tax rate. Operating margin increased due to higher gross margin driven primarily by price increases and manufacturing costs savings. Gross margin expansion was partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to increased marketing spending and higher foreign currency exchange costs. Grooming Grooming net sales grew 11% for the quarter to $1.8 billion on a 6% increase in unit volume. Organic sales were up 4%. Price increases contributed 2% to net sales growth mainly due to price increases taken in Latin America to offset currency devaluations. Negative product mix reduced net sales by 3% due mainly to disproportionate growth of disposable razors in developing regions and entry level shaving systems, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange added 6% to net sales growth for the quarter. Segment volume grew mid single digits in developed regions and high single digits in developing regions. Volume in Male Blades and Razors increased high single digits due to market growth mainly in developing regions and the impact of trade inventory reductions in the prior year period. Gillette Fusion continued to lead volume gains delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Global market share of the blades and razors category was up less than half a point to 72%. Volume in Male Personal Care grew low single digits due to the Zirh acquisition, while organic volume was down low single digits behind market contractions and share losses in Western Europe. Volume in Braun was up mid-single digits behind market growth, particularly in CEEMEA, which was disproportionately impacted by the economic crisis in the prior year period. Global share of the dry shaving market was up about two and a half points to about 33%. Net earnings increased 46% to $377 million for the quarter due to higher net sales, increased operating margin and a lower tax rate. The expansion of operating margin was due to higher gross margin driven by price increases, manufacturing cost savings and volume scale leverage, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage on net sales driven by marketing investments. Grooming net sales were in line with the prior year period at $5.7 billion fiscal year to date on a 2% decline in unit volume. Organic sales were in line with the comparable prior year period. Price increases, taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations and across Blades and Razors, added 4% to net sales. Product mix had a negative 2% impact on net sales due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and of disposable razors, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Volume in Blades and Razors was in line with the prior year period as low single-digit growth in developing regions was offset by a low-single-digit decline in developed regions. Mach3 shipments declined double digits, while Gillette Fusion shipments increased high single digits. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down less than 1 point. Volume in Male Personal Care declined mid-single digits primarily due to share losses resulting from increased competitive promotional activity on shave preparation products in Western Europe and distribution declines on Tag deodorants. Volume in Braun was down mid-single digits due mostly to market contractions, particularly in home and hair care appliances. Net earnings fiscal year to date were up 6% versus the comparable prior year period to $1.2 billion behind a lower tax rate and operating margin expansion. Operating margin increased behind improved gross margin from price increases and lower commodity costs, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales driven by higher foreign currency exchange costs. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales were up 5% to $2.8 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 5% increase in unit volume. Organic sales grew 1%. Mix impacts reduced net sales by 3% mainly as a result of the disproportionate growth of developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Price decreases to improve consumer value lowered net sales by 1%. Favorable foreign exchange added 4% to net sales growth. Volume was strongest in developing regions, up double digits, while volume in developed regions was up low single digits. Oral Care volume increased high single digits driven mainly by increased initiative activity, including Crest 3D White in North America, Oral-B toothpaste expansion in Latin America, Oral-B Pro Health whitespace expansion in Western Europe and Dare to Try commercial innovation in Greater China. Personal Health Care volume declined mid-single digits primarily due to increased competitive activity on Prilosec OTC in North America and the impact of a mild cold and flu season on Vicks shipments. Feminine Care volume grew mid-single digits behind reduced pricing to improve consumer value in CEEMEA, the launch of Naturella in Greater China and the impact of trade inventory reductions in the prior year period. Global market share of the feminine care category was down about half a point. Net earnings increased 5% to $435 million during the quarter mainly due to net sales growth, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined due to higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher gross margin. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher marketing, overhead and foreign currency exchange costs. Gross margin improved behind manufacturing cost savings and improved volume scale leverage. Health Care net sales increased 2% fiscal year to date to $8.9 billion on unit volume growth of 2%. Organic sales also increased 2%. Price increases, taken mainly in developing regions to offset currency devaluations, added 1% to net sales. Negative product mix reduced net sales by 1% due to disproportionate growth of developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Oral Care volume grew mid-single digits behind initiative activity in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia. Personal Health Care volume was in line with the prior year period as growth of diagnostic products and higher shipments of Vicks in developing regions was offset by a continued decline of Prilosec OTC in North America due to increased competitive activity and the prior period divestiture of Thermacare. Feminine Care volume increased low single digits behind initiative-driven growth of Always and Naturella, partially offset by lower shipments of Tampax. Global market share of the feminine care category was down about 1 point. Net earnings were $1.5 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of 8% versus the prior year period behind operating margin expansion and net sales growth. Operating margin increased due to higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin grew behind price increases, lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due mainly to higher foreign currency exchange costs and overhead spending, partially offset by lower marketing spending. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales were $747 million, down 2% for the quarter driven by a unit volume decline of 6%. Organic sales decreased 6%. Favorable foreign exchange added 4% to net sales. Volume in Snacks decreased high single digits primarily due to lower levels of merchandising activity in North America and the discontinuation of some premium snack products. Global market share of the snacks category was in line with the prior year period. Volume in Pet Care was down low single digits mainly due to market contractions in the premium nutrition category. Net earnings increased 51% versus the prior year period to $77 million driven by higher operating margin and a lower tax rate. Operating margin was up behind higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin expanded behind mix from more profitable initiative launches, such as Pringles Super Stack and Iams Prebiotics, as well as lower commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing and overhead spending. Snacks and Pet Care net sales decreased 1% fiscal year to date to $2.3 billion on a 5% decline in unit volume. Organic sales declined 2%. Price increases, taken primarily to offset high commodity costs, added 4% to net sales. Favorable foreign exchange added 1% to net sales. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to the discontinuation of certain premium snack product, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Volume in Snacks was down double-digits behind share losses and market contractions. Global market share of the snacks category was down 1 point. Share losses were driven primarily by lower merchandising activity in North America following the Super Stacks initiative and the discontinuation of some premium snack products. Volume in Pet Care was in line with the prior year period as the continued success of product initiatives was offset by market contraction in the premium nutrition category. Net earnings increased 47% to $249 million fiscal year to date behind higher operating margins and a lower tax rate. Operating margin expanded due to higher gross margin driven by price increases, commodity cost declines and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to increased marketing and overhead spending. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 8% to $5.8 billion for the quarter on a 10% increase in unit volume. Organic sales grew 5%. Mix reduced net sales by 2% due to unfavorable geographic mix and disproportionate growth of laundry powder and mid-tier brands, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Pricing investments to improve consumer value lowered net sales by 3%. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 3% to net sales growth. Each billion dollar brand delivered high single digits or better volume growth for the segment. Fabric Care volume increased high single digits behind targeted price reductions to improve consumer value, higher media weights and trade inventory increases to support merchandising activity in North America. Global market share of the fabric care category was down 1 point to about 29%. Home Care volume was up double digits due to market size expansion, the continued success of new products launched in prior quarters, increased merchandising activity and higher media weights. Batteries volume increased double digits mainly due to reduced pricing to improve consumer value in North America and higher demand from business customers. Net earnings were up 4% for the quarter to $752 million due primarily to net sales growth, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined due to higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher gross margin. Gross margin improved behind manufacturing cost savings and volume scale leverage, partially offset by lower pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was up due to higher marketing spending to support business growth, partially offset by lower overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 3% to $18.3 billion fiscal year to date on a 5% increase in unit volume. Organic sales grew 5%. Pricing was in line with the prior year period as the impact of prior period price increases taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations was offset by more recent price reductions to improve consumer value. Mix lowered net sales by 1% due mainly to unfavorable geographic mix. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%. Fabric Care volume grew low single digits behind new product launches and growth in Western Europe from incremental merchandising activity, partially offset by market share loss. Global market share of the fabric care category was down about 1 point to about 29%. Home Care volume was up high single digits mainly due to market size expansion and share growth behind new product launches. Global market share of the home care category was up less than half a point to 17%. Batteries volume increased mid-single digits primarily due to growth in Greater China, price reductions to improve consumer value in North America, and higher demand from business customers. Net earnings increased 23% to $2.7 billion due to higher net sales, increased operating margin and a lower tax rate. Operating margin expanded due to higher gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased mainly due to lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings, while SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing spending. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 9% to $3.8 billion for the quarter on 10% volume growth. Organic sales grew 7%. Mix lowered net sales growth by 2% due to disproportionate growth of mid-tier products, larger pack counts and developing regions, all of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Price decreases to improve consumer value reduced net sales by 1%. Favorable foreign exchange added 2% to net sales growth. Volume growth was broad-based with all major geographic regions contributing mid-single digits or higher to volume growth, led by double-digit growth in developing regions. Volume in Baby Care grew double digits primarily due to share growth, market size expansion and trade inventory increases to support the launch of Dry Max in North America. Global market share of the baby care category increased over half a point to over 34% driven by price reductions to improve consumer value, increased marketing spending and the continued success of initiatives launched in prior periods. Volume in Family Care was up double digits behind incremental merchandising activity, price reductions to improve consumer value, primarily executed in prior periods, and double-digit growth of Basic product lines. Net earnings grew 32% to $558 million for the quarter driven by net sales growth and operating margin expansion. Operating margin grew behind higher gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin improved primarily due to lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings, while SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing investments. Baby Care and Family Care net sales grew 4% to $11.2 billion fiscal year to date on 6% volume growth. Organic sales increased 5%. Pricing was in line with the prior year period as the impact of price increases taken primarily in developing regions to offset currency devaluations was offset by more recent price reductions to improve consumer value.

Volume in Baby Care increased mid-single digits behind market size expansion and share growth due to incremental initiative activity and price reductions to improve consumer value. Global share of the baby care market was up about half a point. Volume in Family Care grew mid-single digits due to market growth and volume share gains driven by increased merchandising and initiative activity and price reductions to improve consumer value. Net earnings increased 25% to $1.7 billion behind net sales growth and operating margin expansion. Operating margin expansion was driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased mainly due to lower commodity costs and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased behind higher foreign currency exchange costs, incremental marketing investments and additional overhead spending. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since both unconsolidated entities and less than 100% owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. For the Corporate segment, net expenses from continuing operations increased $180 million to $176 million for the quarter. The increase in net expenses was driven primarily by a $152 million charge for a change in legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments and tax adjustments required to reconcile the statutory rates reflected in the business segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest expense, restructuring charges and foreign currency exchange costs. Fiscal year to date, net expenses from continuing operations increased $757 million. The increase was primarily due to current period charges for potential competition law fines and for recently enacted legislation impacting the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments and the impact of prior period divestiture gains and tax audit settlements, partially offset by lower interest expense and restructuring charges. Operating Activities We generated $12.8 billion of cash from operating activities for the fiscal year to date period, an increase of 29% versus the comparable prior year period mainly due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings. On a year-to-date basis, working capital reductions contributed $1.8 billion to operating cash flow primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased primarily due to increased taxes payable, due to the timing of tax payments, and increased expenditures to support business growth, primarily related to the increased marketing investments. Accounts receivable levels increased primarily due to disproportionately higher sales growth in the last month of the quarter. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed $285 million to operating cash flow. Investing Activities Our investing activities generated cash of $970 million fiscal year to date, an increase of $2.2 billion versus the prior year period mainly due to higher proceeds from divestitures. Current year proceeds from asset sales were $3.0 billion due to receipts from the sales of the global pharmaceuticals business, including Actonel in Japan. Prior year period proceeds related to the Folgers, Thermacare and other minor brand divestitures. Capital expenditures were $2.0 billion fiscal year to date or 3.3% of net sales. Acquisitions consumed $65 million of cash primarily to purchase the remaining shares of MDVIP, a physicians’ network focused on preventative medicine. Financing Activities We used $13.5 billion fiscal year to date to fund financing activities. This represents an increase of $6.3 billion versus the prior year period due to increased levels of debt retirement, partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock purchases. Current year net repayments of debt used $6.7 billion, while dividends to shareholders increased to $4.0 billion. Fiscal year to date, we have made $3.4 billion of treasury stock purchases through our share repurchase program and expect to repurchase about $6 billion during fiscal 2010. As of March 31, 2010, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.8 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the January - March quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS : Core EPS is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations excluding charges for pending European legal matters, a charge related to recently enacted legislation which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the United States and the impact of incremental Corporate restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture in the prior period. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The tables below provide reconciliations of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to core earnings per share: Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations Incremental Folgers-related Restructuring Charges Charge for Taxation of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy Charges for Pending European Legal Matters Note – All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The tax impacts on the incremental Folgers-related restructuring charges are ($0.00) for JFM 2009 and ($0.01) for FYTD 2009. The entire amount of the charge for taxation of retiree healthcare subsidy is tax expense. There is no tax impact on the charges for pending European legal matters. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2009. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on pages 47-48, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 58-61 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as updated by the Company’s Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2010. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters and taxes. The Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. The Company is subject to a number of antitrust investigations in Europe. In 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. Also in 2008, authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, France and Greece, as well as some other countries. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. In addition to the complaints issued by France and Italy in a prior quarter, the authorities in Spain have issued a complaint alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in Spain. The Company will have the opportunity to respond to these complaints. The remaining matters discussed above are in various stages of the investigatory process. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products.

We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. Further, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in competitive, product-related and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which could require us to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. In addition, as a U.S. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to interact with internal and external stakeholders. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

All transactions were made in the open market or pursuant to prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company prepays large financial institutions to deliver shares at future dates in exchange for a discount. The number of shares purchased other than through a publicly announced repurchase plan was 30,241 for the quarter. The 30,241 shares were acquired by the Company under various compensation and benefit plans. This table excludes shares withheld from employees to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements on option exercises and other equity-based transactions. The Company administers cashless exercises through an independent, third party broker and does not repurchase stock in connection with cashless exercise. Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission. On August 3, 2007, the Company announced a share repurchase plan. Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, the Board of Directors authorized the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire in open market and/or private transactions $24 to $30 billion of shares of Company common stock over the subsequent three years (through June 30, 2010) to be financed by issuing a combination of long-term and short-term debt. Certain purchases were made prior to announcement of the program but are considered purchases against the program. We expect to repurchase about $6 billion during fiscal 2010.

The Committee adopted its current long-term incentive compensation plan, a three-year plan called the Business Growth Plan (“BGP”), on September 22, 2008. The Committee determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to terminate BGP one year early and adopt a new long-term incentive program that better supports the Company’s business strategies and reinforces the principle of paying for performance. The new plan, called the Performance Stock Program (“PSP”), will continue to focus on the four performance categories that were included in BGP and that the Committee believes are the most critical for creating long-term shareholder value (organic sales, core earnings per share growth, before tax operating profit growth and free cash flow productivity). It also ;includes several new features that are more consistent with the Committee’s principles and objectives of paying for performance, supporting the business strategy and driving superior business results. These new features include: annual grants with overlapping performance periods, the elimination of interim payments, payment entirely in performance-vested equity rather than cash, and more precise performance goals tied to our performance versus peer companies. The PSP is also better aligned with the best practices of our peer companies as most have similar long-term incentive programs. Under the PSP, the Committee will grant each participant performance share units (“PSUs”) that will be earned over a three-year performance period which begins each year on July 1 st , with the first period beginning July 1 st 2010. The number of PSUs granted to each participant will be based on the target long-term incentive compensation for individuals in similar positions at peer group companies after adjusting for the Company’s other long-term incentive programs. The PSUs will vest at the end of the performance period, and the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0-200% of the initial PSU grant based on the Company’s results against performance goals in each of the four categories listed above. Once vested, PSUs will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock distributed to participants following the performance period. A summary of the PSP approved by the Committee is attached as Exhibit 99. In conjunction with the termination of BGP, the Committee approved the final payment under that program based upon the shortened performance period ending on June 30, 2010. Since the program was terminated one year early, the Committee calculated the final payment by (1) reducing each participant’s BGP target award by 1/3 rd ; (2) applying the previously approved BGP sliding scale to establish a payout factor for each performance category based on results achieved as of June 30, 2010; and (3) subtracting the value of any interim payments received. This compensates participants consistent with the orig inal objectives of BGP while avoiding any possibility of “double payment” under BGP and PSP for the current fiscal year. The final payment will be made in RSUs that will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock in September 2011, the same date on which each participant would have received the final BGP payment had the Committee not elected to change the plan. The total payout under BGP was 42% of the reduced target, more than half of which had already been paid to executives pursuant to interim payments. The final payment received by each named executive officer will be as follows: Mr. McDonald - $646,000, Mr. Moeller – $204,000, Mr. Geissler – $295,800, Mr. Panayotopoulos - $309,400, Mr. Shirley - $251,600, and Mr. Steele - $295,800.",741

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fair Value Hierarchy For a discussion of the Company’s fair value measurement policies under the fair value hierarchy, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of September 30 and June 30, 2010 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total assets at fair value (2) Liabilities at fair value: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total liabilities at fair value (3) Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of September 30, 2010 was $177 million. The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $23,707 million and $23,072 million at September 30 and June 30, 2010, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30 and June 30, 2010 are as follows: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships During the next 12 months, the amount of the September 30, 2010 accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) balance that will be reclassified to earnings is expected to be immaterial. The amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Three Months Ended September 30 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended September 30 Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (3) Foreign currency contracts The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships is reclassified from accumulated OCI into net income in the same period during which the related item affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and interest expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in The gain or loss on contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe by the European Commission and national authorities from a number of countries, as detailed in Part 2, Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this 10-Q. These matters involve a number of consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Several countries in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The Company either has, or will have, the opportunity to respond to these complaints. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of these complaints, the Company has reserves totaling $275 million as of September 30, 2010 for potential fines for competition law violations. The ultimate resolution of these matters could result in fines or costs significantly in excess of the amounts reserved. The remaining matters involving the European Commission and various other countries are in various stages of the investigatory process. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. The ultimate resolution of these matters will likely result in fines or other costs that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. In other industries, these fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 1997 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Discontinued Operations In October 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion of cash, net of assumed and transferred liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the employees working on the pharmaceuticals business were transferred to Warner Chilcott. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $1,464 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the pharmaceuticals business: Three months ended September 30 Earnings from discontinued operation Net earnings from discontinued operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our purpose is to provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. On October 30, 2009, we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The table below provides more information about the components of our GBU structure. Cosmetics, Female Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Female Personal Cleansing, Female Shave Care, Hair Care, Hair Color, Hair Styling, Pharmacy Channel, Prestige Products, Salon Head & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, Wella Beauty Electronics, Home Small Appliances, Male Blades and Razors, Male Personal Care Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Water Filtration, Other Oral Care Fabric Care and Home Care Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Gain, Tide Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2010 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2010: Net sales increased 2% to $20.1 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 4%. Unit volume grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby Care and Family Care segments. Net earnings from continuing operations were $3.1 billion, an increase of 2% versus the prior year period mainly due to net sales growth. Net earnings declined 7% to $3.1 billion due to the lost contribution from the discontinued pharmaceuticals business. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% to $1.02. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 4% versus the prior year period to $1.02 as the loss of contribution from discontinued operations was only partially offset by increased earnings from continuing operations. Operating cash flow decreased $2.1 billion versus the prior year period to $2.5 billion mainly due to an increase in working capital. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $1.9 billion. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 63%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in our most recent 10-K filing. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain key information technology systems. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2010 versus the three months ended September 30, 2009. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended September 30 SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Net sales increased 2% to $20.1 billion for the July - September quarter on an 8% increase in unit volume. Volume growth was broad based with growth in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in developing regions. Five of the six business segments contributed to volume growth, led by double-digit growth in the Fabric Care and Home Care and the Baby Care and Family Care segments. Volume in the Beauty, Grooming and Health Care segments was up mid-single digits, while volume in the Snacks and Pet Care segment declined low single digits. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, increased 7%. Price reductions lowered net sales by 1% mainly due to pricing adjustments executed in previous periods, partially offset by price increases taken in developing regions to offset currency devaluations. Negative mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 3% as key foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth was 4% driven by unit volume growth, partially offset by the impact of price reductions and unfavorable mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2010 vs. 2009 (Three Months Ended Sep. 30) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points to 51.9% of net sales in the first fiscal quarter. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by higher commodity and energy costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were in line with the prior year period at $5.9 billion as higher marketing spending was offset by reduced overhead spending and the impact of higher base period foreign currency exchange costs primarily related to our operations in Venezuela. In the prior year period, foreign currency exchange costs related to our operations in Venezuela were approximately $320 million versus approximately $10 million in the current period. These costs included losses incurred to swap bolivars for U.S. dollars in the parallel market and the remeasurement of a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the parallel market exchange rate. See the section titled “Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts” below for additional discussion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined 60 basis points due mainly to scale leverage from an increase in net sales. Interest expense was $208 million for the quarter, down $79 million versus the prior year period primarily due to a reduction in debt outstanding and lower interest rates on floating rate debt. Other non-operating income/(expense), net declined $34 million mainly behind lower interest and investment income and higher provisions for noncontrolling interests due to increased earnings in less than fully-owned subsidiaries. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 28.0% primarily due to audit settlements in the prior year period. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 2% to $3.1 billion for the quarter, in line with net sales growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis points as lower gross margin was largely offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The impact of lower interest expense was largely offset by lower other non-operating income/(expense), net and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% to $1.02. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Net earnings from discontinued operations declined $280 million for the quarter due to the loss of contribution from the global pharmaceuticals business which was divested at the end of October 2009. Net earnings declined 7% for the quarter to $3.1 billion behind a decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share were down 4% to $1.02. The decline in earnings per share was less than the decline in net earnings due to the impact of share repurchases. Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has introduced a number of currency controls for companies operating in Venezuela. Under these controls, there are two official exchange rates for imported goods. Those goods classified as essential, such as food, medicine and capital investments, have an exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, while payments for other non-essential goods have an exchange rate of 4.3. Many of our imported products fall into the essential classification and qualify for the 2.6 rate. However, our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. There are also exchange controls over securities transactions in the parallel market, which has historically been used to pay for imported goods and services that do not qualify for exchange in the official market. The Central Bank of Venezuela is the only legal intermediary through which parallel market transactions can be executed. The government controls the underlying parallel exchange rate which was approximately 5.3 at September 30, 2010. The notional amount of transactions that run through this parallel market mechanism is very restricted, which has eliminated our ability to access the parallel market to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. As of September 30, 2010, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $490 million. Approximately $260 million of this balance has been remeasured using the parallel rate because we plan to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs and our overall repatriation plans, we have exposure for the differential between the official and parallel exchange rates on this portion of our local monetary assets. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors, including the Company’s ability to mitigate the effect of the potential future devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2010 are provided compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2009. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2010 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU Beauty Beauty net sales were in line with the prior year period at $4.9 billion on unit volume growth of 4%. Organic sales grew 3%. Volume in developing regions increased double digits, while volume in developed regions declined low single digits. Mix reduced net sales by 2% behind disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices, and declines in the premium-priced categories of Prestige Products and Salon Professional. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales growth by 2%. Volume in Retail Hair Care increased mid-single digits due to double-digit growth in developing regions behind initiative activity and market growth. Volume in Female Beauty grew mid-single digits primarily behind double-digit growth of Olay, Safeguard and Venus. Volume in Salon Professional declined high single digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses. Volume in Prestige Products was down high single digits behind lower shipments in Western Europe and the divestiture of minor brands. Net earnings increased 7% to $829 million driven by higher operating margin due to higher gross margin and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin expanded behind manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to lower overhead spending and reduced foreign currency exchange costs, partially offset by higher marketing spending. Grooming Grooming net sales increased 2% to $1.9 billion on a 5% increase in unit volume. Organic sales were up 6%. Price increases, taken primarily across blades and razors, added 1% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales growth by 4%. Volume grew double digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Male Grooming volume grew mid-single digits due to higher shipments of blades and razors, mainly in developing regions, and deodorants in North America and Latin America. Appliances volume increased high single digits behind increased shipments of beauty electronics, which includes shavers, epilators and hair care appliances. Global market share of the dry shave category increased over 2 points. Net earnings increased 13% to $398 million driven by higher net sales, increased operating margin and a lower tax rate. Operating margin increased behind higher gross margin and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to improved product mix. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined as lower foreign currency exchange costs and reduced overhead spending were only partially offset by higher marketing spending. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GBU Health Care Health Care net sales were in line with the prior year period at $3.0 billion on unit volume growth of 6%. Organic sales grew 4%. Pricing reduced net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 4%. Volume increased double digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Oral Care volume was up high single digits behind the launch of Crest ProHealth Clinical and ProHealth For Me in North America, expansion of Oral-B toothpaste and success of ProHealth and Complete in Latin America and continued success of Crest ProHealth in Asia. Global market share of the oral care category was up half a point. Personal Health Care volume increased low single digits behind higher shipments of Vicks and PuR, mainly in CEEMEA, partially offset by a continued decline of Prilosec OTC in North America due to increased competitive activity. Feminine Care volume grew mid-single digits due to higher shipments of Naturella behind expansion into China and growth of Always mainly in CEEMEA. Global market share of the feminine care category was down half a point. Net earnings declined 10% to $495 million driven by lower operating margin. Operating margin contracted mainly due to a marketing-spending driven increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales decreased 6% to $709 million on a 1% decline in unit volume. Organic sales were down 9%. Pricing reduced net sales by 2%. Product mix reduced net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate growth of Snacks, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 1%. Organic volume, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, declined 4%. Volume in Snacks increased high single digits mainly due to increased distribution in CEEMEA and Latin America and X-treme and multigrain initiatives in North America and Western Europe. Volume in Pet Care was down high single digits due mainly to supply constraints resulting from a restructuring of the supply chain and following the recall of select dry pet food products, partially offset by the impact of the Natura Pet Products acquisition in June 2010. Net earnings declined 27% to $54 million mainly due to lower net sales and incremental costs related to the pet food recall and supply chain restructuring efforts. HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 3% to $6.3 billion on 10% unit volume growth. Organic sales were up 5% on 9% organic volume growth. Pricing lowered net sales by 2%. Negative product mix reduced net sales by 2% mainly due to disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines and powdered laundry detergents, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Volume in developing regions grew double digits, while volume in developed regions was up high single digits. Volume in Fabric Care increased high single digits mainly due to initiative activity and increased distribution in developing regions. Global market share of the fabric care category increased less than half a point. Volume in Home Care was up double digits driven mainly by initiative launches, market growth and the Ambi Pur acquisition. Global market share of the home care category was up over one point. Volume in Batteries grew high single digits primarily due to price reductions executed through pack count increases in North America, higher demand from business customers and market growth and distribution expansion in developing regions. Global market share of the batteries category increased over half a point. Net earnings decreased 7% to $937 million as sales growth was more than offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin contracted due mainly to lower pricing, unfavorable product mix and higher commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased behind higher marketing spending. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 2% to $3.7 billion on volume growth of 10%. Organic sales grew 5%. Pricing lowered net sales by 2%. Mix reduced net sales by 3% driven mainly by disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, all of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Volume increased double digits in developing regions and high single digits in developed regions. Baby Care volume was up high single digits behind initiative activity, market size growth and distribution expansion, primarily in developing regions. Global market share of the baby care category increased over 1 point. Family Care volume grew double digits behind initiative activity, increased merchandising and additional distribution of Charmin in Latin America. U.S. all outlet share of the family care category increased half a point. Net earnings declined 16% to $470 million as sales growth was more than offset by lower operating margin. Operating margin declined mainly due to lower gross margin driven by higher commodity costs, lower pricing and unfavorable product mix. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to lower foreign currency exchange costs and overhead spending, partially offset by higher marketing spending. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales is generally a negative balance. Negative net sales in Corporate were down 18% primarily due to currency impacts on adjustments required to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities. Net expenses from continuing operations decreased $189 million to $102 million. The decline in net expenses was driven by prior year costs for remeasuring a portion of our local currency denominated net monetary assets in Venezuela and lower current period restructuring-type spending and interest expense. We generated $2.5 billion of cash from operating activities in our first fiscal quarter. This represents a decline of 46% versus the prior year period primarily due to lower net earnings and higher levels of working capital. On a year-to-date basis, working capital consumed $1.3 billion of cash. Accounts receivable used $434 million of cash primarily due to increased sales later in the quarter, growth in categories, such as Respiratory, which have longer average payment terms and to support overall business growth. Inventory consumed $604 million of cash, mainly to support product initiatives and holiday-related shipments in some of our seasonal businesses. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $303 million of cash, primarily related to the payment of prior-year marketing accruals, which were unusually high due to several large initiative launches late in fiscal 2010. Investing Activities Our investing activities consumed cash of $928 million mainly to fund capital expenditures and acquisition activity. Acquisitions consumed $398 million due to the purchase of Ambi Pur, while proceeds from asset sales were minimal. Capital expenditures were $519 million or 2.6% of net sales. We expect capital expenditures of approximately 4% of net sales for the fiscal year. Cash used for investing activities increased $550 million versus the prior year period mainly due to net cash used for acquisitions and lower proceeds from divestitures. Financing Activities Our financing activities consumed net cash of $1.9 billion. We used $3.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $1.4 billion for dividends and partially funded these cash outlays through the issuance of $2.4 billion of short-term debt. We expect to repurchase a total of $6 - $8 billion of treasury stock during fiscal 2011. Cash consumed by financing activities declined $902 million versus the prior year period due to increased levels of debt, partially offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases. As of September 30, 2010, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $7.1 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the July - September quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90% of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2010. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on pages 48-49, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 59-62 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and taxes. As previously reported, the Company is subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. These investigations involve the European Commission, which is investigating potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union, as well as individual investigations by national authorities in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Although non-monetary sanctions are not being sought in any of these matters, competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. To date, authorities in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland have issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws. The Company either has, or will have, the opportunity to respond to these complaints. The remaining matters discussed above are in various stages of the investigatory process. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, reserves as appropriate. However, it is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). discussion of the Company’s risk factors, please refer to Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

The components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31 Three Months Ended December 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) Six Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Expected Return on Plan Assets Amortization of Deferred Amounts Recognized Net Actuarial Loss Gross Benefit Cost (Credit) Dividends on ESOP Preferred Stock Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) For the year ending June 30, 2011, the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% and 9.2% for defined benefit and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fair Value Hierarchy For a discussion of the Company’s fair value measurement policies under the fair value hierarchy, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques for measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of December 31 and June 30, 2010 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total assets at fair value (2) Liabilities at fair value: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total liabilities at fair value (3) Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of non-qualifying foreign currency financial instruments. Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent All derivative liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2010 was $138 million. The Company has not been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $22,743 million and $23,072 million at December 31 and June 30, 2010, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31 and June 30, 2010 are as follows: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships During the next 12 months, the amount of the December 31, 2010 accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) balance that will be reclassified to earnings is expected to be immaterial. The amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (1) Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Amount of Gain(Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (3) Foreign currency contracts The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships is reclassified from accumulated OCI into net income in the same period during which the related item affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and interest expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in The gain or loss on contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe by the European Commission and national authorities from a number of countries, as detailed in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this 10-Q. These matters involve a number of consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Several countries in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The remaining matters involving the European Commission and several other countries are in various stages of the regulatory process. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of the complaints, as well as a final decision issued by the authorities in Italy and additional information disclosed by the authorities in France, the Czech Republic and the European Commission during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Company has reserves totaling $574 million as of December 31, 2010 for potential fines for competition law violations. In accordance with US GAAP, certain of the reserves included in this amount represent the low end of a range of potential outcomes. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2001 and forward. Net adjustments to prior-year tax balances for uncertain tax positions resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $380 million in the current year. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of potential changes to the balance of uncertain tax positions over the next 12 months or the impact of any such changes on the effective tax rate. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Discontinued Operations In October 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion of cash, net of assumed and transferred liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the employees working on the pharmaceuticals business were transferred to Warner Chilcott. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $1,464 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2009. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the pharmaceuticals business: Six months ended December Earnings from discontinued operations Gain on sale of discontinued operations Income tax benefit (expense) on sale Net earnings from discontinued operations The net gain on the sale of the pharmaceuticals business for the six-month period ended December 31, 2009 also includes an after-tax gain on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan, which occurred prior to the divestiture to Warner Chilcott. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations – Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 Results of Operations – Six Months Ended December 31, 2010 Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our purpose is to provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We compete in multiple product categories and have three global business units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. On October 30, 2009, we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The table below provides more information about the components of our GBU structure. Cosmetics, Female Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Female Personal Cleansing, Female Shave Care, Hair Care, Hair Color, Hair Styling, Pharmacy Channel, Prestige Products, Salon Head & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, Wella Beauty Electronics, Home Small Appliances, Male Blades and Razors, Male Personal Care Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Water Filtration, Other Oral Care Fabric Care and Home Care Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Gain, Tide Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three months ended December 31, 2010 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the six months ended December 31, 2010 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2010 versus the six months ended December 31, Net sales increased 2% to $41.5 billion as 7% volume growth was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, mix impacts and lower pricing. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 4%. Operating margin declined 120 basis points behind a commodity-cost driven reduction in gross margin and increased marketing investments, partially offset by reduced foreign currency exchange costs. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 4% to $6.4 billion mainly due to a lower effective tax rate and higher net sales, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Net earnings were $6.4 billion, a decrease of 19% due to the divestiture of the discontinued pharmaceuticals business in the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.13, a decline of 17%. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8% to $2.13. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Core EPS, which is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for pending European legal matters and a significant adjustment to an income tax reserve, increased 4% to $2.15. Operating cash flow decreased $2.5 billion to $5.3 billion mainly due to an increase in working capital. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $4.1 billion. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 64%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Part II Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-Q filing. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain key information technology systems. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2010 versus the three months ended December 31, 2009. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended December 31 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Net sales increased 2% to $21.3 billion on 6% unit volume growth. Volume growth was broad based with growth in all major geographic regions. Volume increased double digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Five of the six business segments grew volume, led by high single-digit growth in the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby Care and Family Care segments. Volume was up mid-single digits in the Beauty, Grooming and Health Care segments, and declined low single digits in the Snacks and Pet Care segment. Negative mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 2% as key foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales were up 3%. Net Sales Change Drivers 2010 vs. 2009 (Three Months Volume excluding Acquisitions Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin declined 190 basis points to 51.8% of net sales for the quarter. The decline was mainly due to 160-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs and unfavorable product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value product. These were partially offset by the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 2% driven by higher marketing and overhead spending, which were mostly offset by the impact of higher foreign currency exchange costs in the base period. Marketing spending increased primarily due to increased investments to support innovation and expansion plans. Overhead spending was up behind investments to support business growth and charges for potential competition law fines (see note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which totaled approximately $305 million in the current period and $267 million in the prior year period. We incurred approximately $226 million of foreign currency exchange costs in the base period primarily to swap Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars in the parallel market and to remeasure a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the parallel market exchange rate. These costs were nominal in the current period. See the section titled “Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts” below for additional discussion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points as higher spending was only partially offset by scale leverage from an increase in net sales. Interest expense declined $15 million versus the prior year period primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income/(expense), net decreased $43 million primarily due to the impact of a prior-year gain on the acquisition of MDVIP, a physicians’ network focused on preventative medicine. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased from 29.8% in the prior year to 17.9% primarily due to 930 basis points of net favorable discrete adjustments to income tax reserves in a number of jurisdictions. Net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions resulted in a benefit of approximately $378 million in the quarter, including a $252 million benefit related to the pending settlement of tax litigation primarily related to the deductibility of technology donations. We do not expect the magnitude of recent benefits from these adjustments to be sustainable. The current-quarter tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of earnings, as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in lower tax jurisdictions during the quarter. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 6% to $3.3 billion driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher net sales, partially offset by a 210-basis point reduction in operating margin. The decline in operating margin resulted largely from a lower gross margin. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% to $1.11. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.5 billion mainly due to the impact of a gain on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business in the prior year period. Net earnings decreased 28% to $3.3 billion driven by the decrease in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share declined 26% to $1.11. The decline in earnings per share was less than the decline in net earnings due to the impact of share repurchases. Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has introduced a number of currency controls for companies operating in Venezuela. During calendar year 2010, there were two official exchange rates for imported goods. Those goods classified as essential, such as food, medicine and capital investments, had an exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, while payments for other non-essential goods had an exchange rate of 4.3. Many of our imported products fell into the essential classification and qualified for the 2.6 rate. In January 2011, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the 2.6 exchange rate on essential goods. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. There are also exchange controls over securities transactions in the parallel market, which has historically been used to pay for imported goods and services that do not qualify for exchange in the official market. The Central Bank of Venezuela is the only legal intermediary through which parallel market transactions can be executed. The government controls the underlying parallel exchange rate which was approximately 5.3 as of December 31, 2010. The notional amount of transactions that run through this parallel market mechanism is very restricted, which has eliminated our ability to access the parallel market to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. As of December 31, 2010, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $590 million. Approximately $280 million of this balance has been remeasured using the parallel rate because we plan to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs and our overall repatriation plans, we have exposure for the differential between the official and parallel exchange rates on this portion of our local monetary assets. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors, including the Company’s ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2010 versus the six months ended December 31, 2009. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Six Months Ended December 31 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS - CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS - CONTINUING OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Net sales increased 2% to $41.5 billion fiscal year to date on a 7% increase in unit volume. Volume growth was broad based with growth in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in Asia and CEEMEA. Five of the six business segments contributed to volume growth, with high single-digit growth in the Fabric Care and Home Care and the Baby Care and Family Care segments, mid-single-digit growth in the Beauty, Grooming and Health Care segments, and a low single-digit decline in the Snacks and Pet Care segment. which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was up 6%. Pricing reduced net sales by 1% mainly due to pricing adjustments executed in previous periods, partially offset by price increases taken in developing regions to offset currency devaluations. Mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 2% as key foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales were up 4% driven by unit volume growth, partially offset by lower pricing and unfavorable mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2010 vs. 2009 (Six Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume excluding Acquisitions Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 51.8% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 160-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs and unfavorable product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value product. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. Total SG&A expense was up 1% to $12.7 billion as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by lower overhead spending and the impact of higher foreign currency exchange costs in the base period. Marketing spending increased behind continued investments in our innovation and expansion plans. Overhead spending declined behind productivity improvements and lower restructuring spending, partially offset by net charges for potential competition law fines (see note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which totaled approximately $306 million in the current year and $267 million in the prior year period. We incurred approximately $546 million of foreign currency exchange costs in the base period primarily to swap Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars in the parallel market and to remeasure a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the parallel market exchange rate. These costs were nominal in the current period. See the section titled “Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts” above for additional discussion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points due to scale leverage from an increase in net sales. Interest expense declined $94 million mainly due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt. Other non-operating income/(expense), net declined $77 million primarily due to the impact of a gain on the acquisition of MDVIP in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased from 28.7% in the prior year to 23.1% primarily due to 460 basis points of net favorable discrete adjustments to income tax reserves in a number of jurisdictions. Net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions resulted in a benefit of approximately $380 million fiscal year to date, including a $252 million benefit related to the pending settlement of tax litigation primarily related to the deductibility of technology donations. We do not expect the magnitude of recent benefits from these adjustments to be sustainable. The tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of earnings, as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in lower tax jurisdictions during the current year. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 4% to $6.4 billion driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher net sales, partially offset by a 120-basis point reduction in operating margin. The decline in operating margin resulted largely from lower gross margin. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8% to $2.13. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.8 billion mainly due to the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business in the prior year period. Net earnings declined 19% to $6.4 billion due to a reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share declined 17% to $2.13. The decline in earnings per share was less than the decline in net earnings due to the impact of share repurchases. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2010 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2010 are provided compared to the same three and six month periods ended December 31, 2009. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2010 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Six Months Ended December 31, 2010 Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Health and Well-Being GBU Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU Beauty Net sales increased 1% to $5.3 billion during the second fiscal quarter. Organic sales grew 3%. Volume grew 5%, while organic volume, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 6%. Volume growth was driven entirely by double-digit growth in developing regions. Lower pricing in developing regions on Retail Hair Care and Female Beauty reduced net sales by 1%. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% due to disproportionate growth in developing regions and Retail Hair Care, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 1%. Volume in Retail Hair Care grew high single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions primarily due to initiative activity, lower pricing and distribution expansions in Asia and Latin America. Volume in Female Beauty was up mid-single digits mainly due to skin care initiatives and market growth in Asia and the continued success of female blades and razors initiatives in North America and Western Europe. Volume in Salon Professional declined double digits due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and lower shipments in developed markets. Volume in Prestige Products was down low single digits due to the divestiture of minor brands, while organic volume was up low single digits behind market growth in Asia and the continued success of new fragrance launches in the prior quarter. Net earnings increased 2% to $896 million driven by higher net sales and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower operating margin. Operating margin contracted behind lower gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined primarily due to higher commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased mainly due to lower foreign currency exchange costs and reduced overhead spending, mostly offset by increased marketing spending. The effective tax rate was down due to favorable geographic mix of earnings. Net sales increased 1% to $10.2 billion fiscal year to date on unit volume growth of 5%. Organic sales grew 3%. Mix negatively impacted net sales growth by 2% behind disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices, and declines in the premium-priced categories of Prestige Products and Salon Professional. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Volume in developing regions increased double digits, while volume in developed regions declined low single digits. Volume in Retail Hair Care grew high single digits due to double-digit growth in developing regions behind initiative activity, price reductions, distribution expansions and market growth. Volume in Female Beauty was up mid-single digits primarily due to higher shipments of Olay, Safeguard and Venus behind initiative activity, distribution expansion and market growth. Volume in Salon Professional was down high single digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and lower shipments in developed markets. Volume in Prestige Products declined mid-single digits primarily due the divestiture of minor brands and lower shipments in Western Europe. Net earnings increased 4% to $1.7 billion due to higher net sales, operating margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. Operating margin increased due to lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined behind lower overhead spending and reduced foreign currency exchange costs, partially offset by higher marketing spending. The effective tax rate decreased due to favorable geographic mix of earnings. Grooming Net sales increased 3% to $2.2 billion for the quarter on a 5% increase in unit volume. Organic sales were up 6%. Price increases, taken primarily across blades and razors, added 1% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales growth by 3%. Volume growth was led by high single-digits growth in developing regions, while developed regions delivered low single-digit growth. Volume in Male Grooming increased mid-single digits primarily due to growth of blades and razors in developing regions and deodorants in North America. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down nearly 1 point. Volume in Appliances declined low single digits due to lower shipments of epilators and hair care appliances, primarily in CEEMEA. Global market share of the dry shaving category was down about 1 point. Net earnings increased 11% to $482 million driven by net sales growth and a lower effective tax rate. Operating margin increased slightly, as a higher gross margin was mostly offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin expanded primarily behind the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing spending, partially offset by lower foreign currency exchange costs. The effective tax rate was down due to favorable geographic mix of earnings. Net sales increased 3% to $4.1 billion fiscal year to date on volume growth of 5%. Organic sales were up 6%. Price increases, taken primarily across blades and razors, contributed 1% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Volume grew high single digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Volume in Male Grooming was up mid-single digits due to higher shipments of blades and razors, mainly in developing regions driven by market growth, and deodorants in North America. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down about half a point. Volume in Appliances increased low single digits behind higher shipments of male shavers and hair care appliances in Western Europe. Global market share of the dry shave category was up less than half a point. Net earnings increased 12% to $880 million behind higher net sales, increased operating margin and a lower effective tax rate.

Oral Care volume increased high single digits behind initiative activity and incremental merchandising support behind Crest 3D White in North America, Oral-B toothpaste in Brazil, Belgium and Holland and the Pro-Health innovation in multiple markets around the world. Global market share of the oral care category was up over half a point. Personal Health Care volume was up low single digits mainly due to higher shipments of Vicks in Latin America and Asia and increased distribution of PuR in CEEMEA, partially offset by lower shipments of diagnostics products. Feminine Care volume grew mid-single digits due to the expansion of Naturella into China and Brazil and Always initiatives in China and India. Net earnings declined 1% to $531 million, as higher net sales were more than offset by lower operating margin. Operating margin declined due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin contracted mainly due to higher commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased mainly due to higher marketing spending, mostly offset by lower foreign currency exchange costs.

Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the Natura Pet Products acquisition, were down 8% on a 6% decline in organic volume. Mix lowered net sales by 1% primarily due to the disproportionate growth of Snacks, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%. Snacks volume increased mid-single digits mainly due to double-digit growth in developing regions behind increased distribution and incremental merchandising activity. Pet Care volume was down double digits due mainly to supply constraints resulting from a restructuring of the supply chain and following the recall of select dry pet food products, partially offset by the impact of the Natura acquisition in June 2010. Net earnings decreased 32% to $67 million due to lower net sales and a reduced operating margin driven by incremental costs and reduced scale leverage resulting from the pet food recalls and related supply constraints. Net sales decreased 5% to $1.5 billion fiscal year to date on a 1% decline in unit volume. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the Natura acquisition, were down 9% on a 5% decline in organic volume. Lower pricing in developed regions reduced net sales by 1%.

Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by 1%. Snacks volume increased mid-single digits mainly due to increased distribution in CEEMEA and Latin America and X-treme and multigrain initiatives in North America and Western Europe. Pet Care volume was down double digits due mainly to the impacts of the voluntary pet food recalls and associated supply constraints resulting from a restructuring of the supply chain, partially offset by the impact of the Natura acquisition in June 2010. Net earnings decreased 30% to $121 million mainly due to lower net sales and a reduced operating margin driven by incremental costs and reduced scale leverage related to the pet food recall and supply chain restructuring efforts.

Global market share of the home care category was up over 1 point. Batteries volume grew high single digits primarily due to market share gains behind incremental holiday merchandising in North America, initiative activity in Western Europe and market growth and distribution expansion in Asia. Net earnings declined 21% to $758 million mainly due to operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined behind a lower gross margin and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales.

Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Volume in developing regions was up double digits, while volume in developed regions increased mid-single digits. Volume in Baby Care grew high single digits mainly due to growth in developing regions behind initiative activity, distribution expansion and market growth. Global market share of the baby care category increased over 1 point. Volume in Family Care was up high single digits behind the continued impact of prior-period initiative launches, growth of Charmin Basic in North America and lower price gaps versus competition in Latin America. Net earnings declined 13% to $502 million as sales growth was more than offset by a lower operating margin. Operating margin decreased mainly due to a lower gross margin driven by higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix due to disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions. Net sales increased 2% to $7.6 billion fiscal year to date on 9% volume growth. Organic sales were up 5%. Price reductions initiated in prior periods lowered net sales growth by 1%.

U.S. all outlet share of the family care category increased about half a point. Net earnings decreased 14% to $972 million driven by operating margin contraction, partially offset by sales growth. Operating margin declined mainly due to a lower gross margin as higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix, behind disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, were only partially offset by the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly due to lower foreign currency exchange costs and overhead spending, mostly offset by higher marketing spending. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Net sales in the Corporate segment primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally a negative balance. Negative net sales were down $38 million in the second fiscal quarter and down $116 million fiscal year to date primarily due to adjustments required to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities. Corporate had net earnings of $97 million in the quarter versus net expenses of $336 million in the prior year period mainly due to the net benefit of discrete tax adjustments to income tax reserves and the favorable settlement of a value added tax audit. Net expenses declined $622 million fiscal year to date driven by the aforementioned benefits from discrete tax adjustments, higher base period foreign currency exchange costs and lower current period restructuring-type spending. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated $5.3 billion from operating activities during the fiscal year to date period. This represents a 32% decline versus the prior year period primarily due to higher levels of cash invested in working capital. On a year-to-date basis, working capital consumed $2.1 billion primarily behind higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Accounts receivable used $931 million mainly due to higher sales in December relative to June and growth in regions and categories with longer average payment terms. Inventory consumed $779 million driven by initiative activity, business growth, higher commodity costs and increased safety stock levels behind customer service improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $377 million primarily to satisfy marketing and capital commitments accrued for at the end of the 2010 fiscal year. Other operating assets and liabilities consumed $650 million mainly due to lower net liabilities for unrecognized tax positions. Investing Activities We consumed $1.5 billion to fund investing activities primarily to support capital expenditures and acquisitions in the current period. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion or 3.0 % of net sales. We expect capital expenditures of approximately 4% of net sales for the fiscal year. Acquisitions consumed $435 million mainly due to the purchase of Ambi Pur, while proceeds from asset sales were minimal. Prior-year cash generated from investing activities was $1.6 billion, as normal ongoing capital investments was more than offset by proceeds from divestitures driven by the sale of the global pharmaceuticals business in October 2009. Financing Activities We utilized $3.5 billion for financing activities. We continued to return cash to shareholders by purchasing $3.5 billion of treasury stock and paying $2.8 billion in dividends. We received $2.3 billion primarily behind the proceeds from additional debt issuances. We expect to repurchase a total of $6 - $8 billion of treasury stock during fiscal 2011. In the prior year period, we consumed $10.3 billion to fund financing activities, primarily due to debt repayments. As of December 31, 2010, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.4 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the October - December quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS: This is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for pending European legal matters and a significant adjustment to an income tax reserve related to the deductibility of technology donations in prior years. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations Significant Adjustment to Income Tax Reserve Charges for Pending European Legal Matters Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations Significant Adjustment to Income Tax Reserve Charges for Pending European Legal Matters Note – All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2010. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on pages 48-49, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 59-62 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and taxes. As previously reported, the Company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. These investigations involve the European Commission, which is investigating potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union, as well as individual investigations by national authorities in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Although non-monetary sanctions are not being sought in any of these matters, competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As previously disclosed, as a result of the investigations discussed above, authorities in several countries have issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. During the most recent quarter, there were further developments. The United Kingdom authority closed its investigation without issuing any penalty to the Company. Authorities in Italy issued a final decision resulting in monetary damages and authorities in France, the Czech Republic and the European Commission disclosed additional information to the Company regarding their respective investigations. Pursuant to these activities, the Company took additional reserves for potential fines. The remaining matters are in various stages of the regulatory process. The Company will continue to take reserves as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these matters may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company’s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase compliance risks, including anti-corruption. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. Our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in competition, product-related, privacy and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and enforcement penalties. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, as a U.S. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to interact with internal and external stakeholders. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, we are transitioning our ordering, shipping and billing systems in North America and Western Europe to a new system during fiscal 2011. If the new system does not function properly upon implementation, our ability to process and deliver customer orders in our two largest regions could be limited and could negatively impact our results of operations during the period(s) of transition. Also, we may be unable to process and receive payments for products sold which could negatively impact our cash flow results during those periods.

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For details on the Company’s risk management activities, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fair Value Hierarchy For a discussion of the Company’s fair value measurement policies under the fair value hierarchy, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques for measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total assets at fair value (2) Liabilities at fair value: Other foreign currency instruments (1) Total liabilities at fair value (3) Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of non-qualifying foreign currency financial instruments. Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent All derivative liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of March 31, 2011 was $146 million. The Company has not been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $22,996 million and $23,072 million at March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010 are as follows: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period. Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships During the next 12 months, the amount of the March 31, 2011 accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) balance that will be reclassified to earnings is expected to be immaterial. The amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions for the three-month and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (1) Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Foreign currency contracts Amount of Gain(Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships (2) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (3) Foreign currency contracts The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships is reclassified from accumulated OCI into net income in the same period during which the related item affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in The gain or loss on contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is and has been subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe by the European Commission and national authorities from a number of countries. These matters involve a number of consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The remaining authorities’ investigations are in various stages of the regulatory process. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of the complaints, as well as final decisions issued by the authorities in Spain and Czech Republic during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and by the European Commission in April 2011, the Company has reserves totaling $606 million as of March 31, 2011 for potential fines for competition law violations. In accordance with US GAAP, certain of the reserves included in this amount represent the low end of a range of potential outcomes. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 - 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2001 and forward. Net adjustments to prior-year tax balances for uncertain tax positions resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $424 million in the current year. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of potential changes to the balance of uncertain tax positions over the next 12 months or the impact of any such changes on the effective tax rate. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Discontinued Operations In October 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion of cash, net of assumed and transferred liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the employees working on the pharmaceuticals business were transferred to Warner Chilcott. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $1,464 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2010. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Following is selected financial information included in net earnings from discontinued operations for the pharmaceuticals business: Earnings from discontinued operations Gain on sale of discontinued operations Income tax benefit (expense) on sale Net earnings from discontinued operations The net gain on the sale of the pharmaceuticals business for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2010 also includes an after-tax gain on the sale of the Actonel brand in Japan, which occurred prior to the divestiture to Warner Chilcott. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: Forward-Looking Statements Results of Operations - Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011 Business Segment Discussion - Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax profit. We also refer to organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. These financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of such information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. OVERVIEW P&G’s business is focused on providing branded consumer goods products. Our purpose is to provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. We believe this will result in leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and “high frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We compete in multiple product categories and have two global business units (GBUs): the Beauty and Grooming GBU and the Household Care GBU. Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries through our Market Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands in local markets and is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. On October 30, 2009, we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. The table below provides more information about the components of our reportable business segment structure. Cosmetics, Female Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Female Personal Cleansing, Female Shave Care, Hair Care, Hair Color, Hair Styling, Pharmacy Channel, Prestige Products, Salon Head & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, Wella Beauty Electronics, Home Small Appliances, Male Blades and Razors, Male Personal Care Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Water Filtration, Other Oral Care Fabric Care and Home Care Laundry Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Gain, Tide, Febreze Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2011 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2011 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2010: Net sales increased 3% to $61.7 billion as 6% volume growth was partially offset by 2 points from negative mix and 1 point from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 4%. Operating margin declined 150 basis points behind a commodity-cost driven reduction in gross margin and increased marketing investments, partially offset by reduced foreign currency exchange costs. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 6% to $9.3 billion mainly due to a lower effective tax rate and higher net sales, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% to $3.09. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Net earnings were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 12% due to the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business in the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share were $3.09, a decrease of 9%. Core EPS, which is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding US healthcare reform legislation costs in the base period, pending European legal matters and a significant adjustment to an income tax reserve, increased 5% to $3.10. Operating cash flow decreased $3.4 billion to $9.4 billion mainly due to an increase in working capital. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $7.3 billion. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 79%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements,” and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Part II Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-Q filing. Ability to Achieve Business Plans: We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain patents and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain key information technology systems. Cost Pressures: Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions: Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters, such as the civil unrest in the Middle East and the Japan crisis, may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. Regulatory Environment: Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2011 versus the three months ended March 31, 2010. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended March 31 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Net sales increased 5% to $20.2 billion on 5% unit volume growth. Volume growth was broad based with growth in all major geographic regions. Volume increased high single digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. All six of the business segments grew volume, led by high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care, and Snacks and Pet Care segments. Volume was up mid-single digits in the Fabric Care and Home Care, Beauty, and Health Care segments, and increased low single digits in the Grooming segment. Increased volume in advance of planned customer order system conversion in North America and Western Europe was largely offset by volume reductions from political disruptions in the Middle East. Higher prices increased net sales by 1%. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 1% as key foreign currencies strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. Negative mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and low and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Organic sales were up 4% on organic volume growth of 5%. Net Sales Change Drivers 2011 vs. 2010 (Three Months Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 50.5% of net sales for the quarter. The decline was mainly due to a 200-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs and unfavorable product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and low and mid-tier value product. These were partially offset by the favorable impact of manufacturing cost savings and pricing. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 8% driven by higher marketing and overhead spending and foreign currency impacts. Marketing and overhead spending increased primarily due to increased investments to support innovation and expansion plans. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 70 basis points due to higher marketing spending and foreign exchange costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in overhead spending as a percentage of net sales. Interest expense declined $21 million versus the prior year period primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income/(expense), increased $54 million primarily due to a gain on the divestiture of the Zest brand in North America. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased from 31.3% in the prior year to 21.1%. Approximately 530 basis points of this decline is due to the impact of discrete tax adjustments in both periods, including a $152 million base period charge for legislation that changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription subsidy payments in the United States and a current period benefit for a number of minor adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions. The remaining decline relates primarily to more favorable mix of earnings in the current year as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in lower tax jurisdictions during the current year. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% to $2.9 billion driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate. The impact of higher net sales was largely offset by a 210-basis point reduction in operating margin. The decline in operating margin resulted largely from a lower gross margin and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing spending and foreign exchange impacts as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in overhead as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% to $0.96. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2011 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2010. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Nine Months Ended March 31 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS - CONTINUING OPERATIONS BASIC NET EARNINGS - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS - CONTINUING OPERATIONS DILUTED NET EARNINGS - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Net sales increased 3% to $61.7 billion fiscal year to date on a 6% increase in unit volume. Volume growth was broad based with growth in all geographic regions, led by double-digit growth in Asia and high single digit growth in Latin America and CEEMEA. All six of the business segments contributed to volume growth, with high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care and Fabric Care and Home Care segments, mid-single-digit growth in the Beauty, Grooming and Health Care segments, and a low single-digit increase in the Snacks and Pet Care segment. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was up 6%. Mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and low and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered net sales by 1% as key foreign currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales were up 4% driven by unit volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2011 vs. 2010 (Nine Months Ended Mar. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin contracted 140 basis points to 51.4% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 180-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs and unfavorable product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and low and mid-tier value product. These impacts were partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. Total SG&A expense was up 3% to $19.2 billion, primarily due to higher marketing spending which was partially offset by the impact of higher foreign currency exchange costs in the base period. Marketing spending increased behind continued investments in our innovation and expansion plans. We incurred approximately $530 million of foreign currency exchange costs in the base period primarily to swap Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars in the parallel market and to remeasure a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the parallel market exchange rate. These costs were nominal in the current period. See the section titled “Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts” below for additional discussion. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally as increased marketing as a percentage of net sales was mostly offset by a reduction in foreign exchange costs and reduced overhead as a percentage of net sales. Interest expense declined $115 million mainly due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt. Other non-operating income/(expense), net declined $23 million primarily due to the impact of a gain on the acquisition of MDVIP in the prior year period, partially offset a gain on the divestiture of the Zest brand in North America in the current year. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased from 29.5% in the prior year to 22.5%. Net favorable discrete adjustments to income tax reserves in a number of jurisdictions in the current year, as compared to unfavorable adjustments in the prior year resulted in a 420 basis points reduction in the effective tax rate. Net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions resulted in a benefit of approximately $424 million fiscal year to date, including a $252 million benefit related to the pending settlement of tax litigation primarily related to the deductibility of technology donations. We do not expect the magnitude of recent benefits from these adjustments to be sustainable. The tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of earnings, as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in lower tax jurisdictions during the current year. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 6% to $9.3 billion driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher net sales, partially offset by a 150-basis point reduction in operating margin. The decline in operating margin resulted largely from lower gross margin. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% to $3.09. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.8 billion mainly due to the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business in the prior year period. Net earnings declined 12% to $9.3 billion due to a reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from continuing operations. Diluted net earnings per share declined 9% to $3.09. The decline in earnings per share was less than the decline in net earnings due to the impact of share repurchases. Foreign Currency Translation - Venezuela Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has introduced a number of currency controls for companies operating in Venezuela. During calendar year 2010, there were two official exchange rates for imported goods. Those goods classified as essential, such as food, medicine and capital investments, had an exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, while payments for other non-essential goods had an exchange rate of 4.3. Many of our imported products fell into the essential classification and qualified for the 2.6 rate. In January 2011, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the 2.6 exchange rate on essential goods. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. There are also exchange controls over securities transactions in the parallel market, which has historically been used to pay for imported goods and services that do not qualify for exchange in the official market. The Central Bank of Venezuela is the only legal intermediary through which parallel market transactions can be executed. The government controls the underlying parallel exchange rate which was approximately 5.3 as of March 31, 2011. The notional amount of transactions that run through this parallel market mechanism is very restricted, which has eliminated our ability to access the parallel market to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. As of March 31, 2011, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $709 million. Approximately $251 million of this balance has been remeasured using the parallel rate because we plan to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs and our overall repatriation plans, we have exposure for the differential between the official and parallel exchange rates on this portion of our local monetary assets. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors, including the Company’s ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2011 are provided compared to the same three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2010. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings from continuing operations by business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2011 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Nine Months Ended March 31, 2011 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Net sales increased 5% to $4.9 billion during the third fiscal quarter. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume grew 5%, while organic volume, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 6%. Volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in developing regions, while volume in the developed regions was in line with the prior year. Higher pricing in Latin America and Prestige increased net sales by 1%. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 2%. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 3% due to disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices, and a decrease in Salon Professional volume, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Volume in Retail Hair Care grew high single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions due to initiative activity and distribution expansions in Asia and Latin America. Global market share of the hair care category was up nearly half a point. Volume in Female Beauty was in line with the prior period as Olay skin care distribution expansion in Asia and Latin America and deodorants growth in North America were offset by a mid-single digit decline in developed regions driven by the Zest divestiture, competitive activity in cosmetics, and decreased shipments in skin due to an Olay UV reformulation and restage. Volume in Salon Professional declined high single digits due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and market contraction in Western Europe. Volume in Prestige Products was up high single digits behind the continued impact of fragrance initiatives, partially offset by minor brand divestitures. Excluding the minor brand divestitures, volume increased double digits. Net earnings decreased 3% to $547 million as sales growth was more than offset by a lower operating margin. Operating margin contracted primarily behind higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased mainly due to increased marketing spending, partially offset by a decrease in overhead spending as a percentage of sales. Net sales increased 2% to $15.1 billion fiscal year to date on unit volume growth of 5%. Organic sales grew 3%. Mix negatively impacted net sales growth by 2% behind disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices, and declines in the premium-priced categories of Prestige Products and Salon Professional. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%. Volume in developing regions increased double digits, while volume in developed regions declined low single digits. Volume in Retail Hair Care grew high single digits due to double-digit growth in developing regions behind initiative activity, price reductions, distribution expansions and market growth. Global market share of the hair care category was up slightly. Volume in Female Beauty was up low single digits primarily due to higher shipments of Olay, Safeguard and Venus behind initiative activity, distribution expansion and market growth. Volume in Salon Professional was down high single digits mainly due to the exit of non-strategic businesses and market size contractions in developed regions. Volume in Prestige Products declined low single digits primarily due to the divestiture of minor brands and lower shipments in Western Europe. Excluding the minor brand divestitures, volume increased low single digits. Net earnings increased 3% to $2.3 billion, consistent with sales growth. Operating margin was comparable with the prior year, as higher marketing spending was largely offset by lower overhead spending and reduced foreign currency exchange costs. The effective tax rate decreased due to favorable geographic mix of earnings. Grooming Net sales increased 8% to $1.9 billion for the quarter on a 2% increase in unit volume. Organic sales were up 7%. Price increases taken primarily across blades and razors in Latin America and developed regions, added 5% to net sales growth. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales growth by 1%. Volume growth was driven by high single-digit growth in developing regions, which was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in developed regions. Volume in Male Grooming increased low single digits primarily due to high-single-digit growth of blades and razors in developing regions, particularly Latin America and Asia, as well as deodorants in North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in blades and razors in the developed regions. In the developed regions, double-digit growth of Fusion was more than offset by declines of Mach 3 and other legacy blades and razors. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down 1 point. Volume in Appliances decreased high single digits due to continuing economic difficulties in Western Europe as well as a high base period behind Hair Care appliances initiatives. Global market share of the dry shaving category was down more than half a point. Net earnings increased 1% to $379 million driven by net sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Operating margin grew due to improved gross margin, driven primarily by higher prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was comparable to the prior year as higher marketing spending was largely offset by reduced overhead as a percentage of sales driven by scale efficiencies. The effective tax rate was higher due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. Net sales increased 4% to $6.0 billion fiscal year to date on volume growth of 4%. Organic sales were up 6%. Price increases, taken primarily across blades and razors in Latin America and developed regions, contributed 2% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Volume grew high single digits in developing regions and was in line with the prior year period in developed regions. Volume in Male Grooming was up mid-single digits due to higher shipments of blades and razors, mainly in developing regions driven by market growth, and deodorants in North America, partially offset by softness in blades and razors in the developed regions. Global market share of the blades and razors category was down more than half a point. Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits due to continuing economic difficulties in Western Europe as well as a high base period behind Hair Care appliances initiatives. Global market share of the dry shave category was in line with the prior year period. Net earnings increased 8% to $1.3 billion behind higher net sales and increased operating margin. Operating margin expanded due to higher gross margin and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to price increases and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down due to lower foreign currency exchange costs and reduced overhead spending, partially offset by higher marketing spending. Health Care Net sales increased 6% during the third fiscal quarter to $3.0 billion on unit volume growth of 4%. Organic sales grew 5%. Price increases in developing regions contributed 1% to net sales. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 1%. Volume was up mid-single digits in both developed and developing regions. Volume in Oral Care was up mid-single digits due to the continued strength and incremental merchandising support behind Crest 3D White in North America, Oral-B toothpaste expansions in Brazil, Belgium and Holland and toothbrush initiatives in Asia. Global market share of the oral care category was up over a point. Volume in Personal Health Care was up high single digits primarily due to double-digit growth in North America behind initiative activity and a strong cold and cough season. Volume in Feminine Care grew low single digits due to the expansion of Naturella into China and Always initiatives in Asia and Western Europe. Net earnings declined 2% to $427 million, as higher net sales were more than offset by lower operating margin. Operating margin declined due to lower gross margin driven mainly by higher commodity costs. Net sales increased 3% to $9.1 billion fiscal year to date on 5% growth in unit volume. Organic sales were up 4%. Price decreases in developed regions reduced net sales by 1%. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales growth by 1%. Volume increased high single digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Volume in Oral Care grew high single digits behind initiative activity and incremental merchandising support of Crest and Oral-B. Global market share of the oral care category was up nearly a point. Volume in Personal Health Care grew mid-single digits behind higher shipments of Vicks and increased distribution of PuR in CEEMEA, partially offset by lower shipments of Prilosec OTC in North America. Volume in Feminine Care was up mid-single digits mainly due to higher shipments of Naturella, behind expansion into developing regions, and Always, behind initiative activity in developing regions. Global market share of the feminine care category was down less than half a point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $1.5 billion as higher net sales were more than offset by lower operating margins. Operating margin contracted due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined mainly due to higher commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased behind higher marketing spending, partially offset by lower foreign currency exchange costs. In March 2011, P&G and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries announced that the companies have reached an agreement to create a partnership in consumer health care by bringing together both companies’ existing over-the-counter medicines and complementary capabilities. The partnership is expected to have over $1 billion in sales, only a portion of which will be incremental to our consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the transaction to close by the end of the 2011 calendar year, pending necessary regulatory approvals. Snacks and Pet Care Net sales increased 7% to $799 million for the quarter on a 7% increase in unit volume. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the Natura Pet Products acquisition, were in line with prior year on a 4% increase in organic volume. Mix lowered net sales by 2% primarily due to the disproportionate growth of developing regions and Snacks, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 2%. Snacks volume increased double digits behind increased distribution in the developing regions and incremental merchandising activity in the developed regions. Pet Care volume was up low single digits due to the impact of the Natura acquisition in June 2010, partially offset by the impacts of supply constraints following the pet food recall. Excluding the Natura acquisition, Pet Care volume decreased mid-single digits. Net earnings decreased 21% to $61 million as net sales growth was more than offset by a lower operating margin. Operating margin decreased mainly due to a lower gross margin driven by increased product costs resulting from the pet food supply disruptions and negative product mix. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased marginally behind lower marketing spending primarily in Pet Care, which was largely offset by increased overhead spending. Net sales decreased 1% to $2.3 billion fiscal year to date on a 1% increase in unit volume. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the Natura acquisition, were down 6% on a 2% decline in organic volume. Lower pricing in developed regions reduced net sales by 1%. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of Snacks and developing regions, both of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Snacks volume increased high single digits mainly due to increased distribution in CEEMEA and Latin America, as well as initiatives and incremental merchandising activity. Pet Care volume was down mid-single digits mainly due to the impacts of the supply constraints resulting from a restructuring of the supply chain following the voluntary pet food recalls, partially offset by the impact of the Natura acquisition in June 2010. Excluding the Natura acquisition, Pet Care volume decreased double digits. Net earnings decreased 27% to $182 million mainly due to lower net sales and a reduced operating margin driven by incremental costs and reduced scale leverage related to the pet food recall and supply chain restructuring efforts. In April 2011, we announced plans to divest the Company’s Snacks business through a merger with Diamond Foods, Inc in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction. The Snacks business had net sales of approximately $1.4 billion and operating income of about $170 million in fiscal 2010. The Company expects the transaction to close by the end of the 2011 calendar year, pending necessary regulatory approvals. Fabric Care and Home Care Net sales increased 5% to $6.1 billion for the quarter on a 6% increase in unit volume. Organic sales, which excludes the impact of the Ambi Pur acquisition and foreign exchange, increased 3% on 5% organic volume growth. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% primarily due to disproportionate growth of low and mid-tier product lines, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 1%. Volume increased high single digits in developing regions and mid-single digits in developed regions. Fabric Care volume was up mid-single digits due to the strength of prior period initiative launches such as liquitabs in Western Europe and laundry additives, as well as market growth in developing regions. Global market share of the fabric care category increased about half a point. Home Care volume increased double digits driven by initiatives, geographic expansion of dish and air care product lines, and the Ambi Pur acquisition. Excluding the Ambi Pur acquisition, Home Care volume increased high single digits. Global market share of the home care category was up nearly a point. Batteries volume was consistent with the prior year period as initiatives and distribution expansion in the current year period were offset by a spike in shipments in the base period following consumer value corrections in North America. Net earnings were in line with the prior year period at $754 million as sales growth was offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined behind reduced gross margin, partially offset by reduced SG&A as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was down due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was down due to a reduction in marketing spending, partially offset by increased overhead spending. Net sales increased 2% to $18.7 billion fiscal year to date. Organic sales were up 3%. Volume grew 7%, while organic volume, which excludes the impact of the Ambi Pur acquisition, increased 6%. Lower pricing, mainly in developed regions, reduced net sales by 1%. Mix negatively impacted net sales growth by 2% mainly due to disproportionate growth of low and mid-tier product lines and powdered laundry detergents, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales growth by 2%. Volume in developing regions was up double digits, while volume in developed regions grew mid-single digits. Fabric Care volume increased mid-single digits mainly due to growth in developing regions behind initiative activity, increased distribution and market growth. Global market share of the fabric care category increased about half a point. Home Care volume increased double digits due, in part, to the Ambi Pur acquisition. Organic volume in Home Care was also up double digits driven mainly by initiative activity, including the prior-period launches of Gain hand dishwashing liquid and Febreze Set & Refresh in North America, and geographic expansion of dish and air care product lines. Global market share of the home care category was up over 1 point. Batteries volume grew mid-single digits primarily due to price reductions executed through pack count increases in North America, which were implemented in January 2010, initiative activity in Western Europe and market growth and distribution expansion in Asia. Global market share of the batteries category increased about 1 point. Net earnings decreased 10% to $2.4 billion as net sales growth was more than offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined primarily due to lower gross margin, mainly due to higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix behind disproportionate growth of developing regions and low and mid-tier value products. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally behind higher marketing spending. Baby Care and Family Care Net sales increased 5% to $4.0 billion for the quarter on 7% volume growth. Organic sales were up 5%. Price increases primarily in developing regions improved net sales by 1%. Mix reduced net sales by 2% driven by disproportionate growth of mid-tier and value product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, all of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1%. Volume in developing regions was up double digits and volume in developed regions increased low single digits. Volume in Baby Care grew high single digits due to initiative activity, distribution expansion and market growth in Europe and developing regions; partially offset by the impact of the North American launch of Pampers Dry Max in the base period. Global market share of the baby care category increased nearly 1 point. Volume in Family Care was up mid-single digits behind the continued impact of prior-period initiative launches across Charmin and Bounty, and growth of Charmin Basic in North America. Net earnings declined 5% to $528 million as sales growth was more than offset by a lower operating margin. Operating margin decreased mainly due to a lower gross margin driven by higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix due to disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions. Net sales increased 3% to $11.5 billion fiscal year to date on 9% volume growth. Organic sales were up 5%. Price reductions executed in prior periods lowered net sales by 1%. Mix reduced net sales by 3% driven mainly by disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, all of which have lower than segment average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales growth by 2%. Volume grew double digits in developing regions and mid-single digits in developed regions. Volume in Baby Care was up high single digits primarily due to growth in developing regions behind initiative activity, market size growth and distribution expansion. Global market share of the baby care category increased over 1 point. Volume in Family Care increased high single digits driven by the continued impact of initiative launches from prior periods, growth of Charmin Basic in North America and lower price gaps versus competition in Latin America. U.S. all outlet share of the family care category increased over half a point. Net earnings decreased 11% to $1.5 billion as sales growth was more than offset by a lower operating margin. Operating margin declined mainly due to a lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased as higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix, behind disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, were only partially offset by the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was in line with the prior year period as increased marketing spending was largely offset by lower foreign currency exchange costs. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment after-tax net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company’s effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Net sales in the Corporate segment primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally a negative balance. Negative net sales were up $28 million in the third fiscal quarter and down $88 million fiscal year to date primarily due to adjustments required to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities. Corporate had net earnings of $177 million in the quarter versus net expenses of $176 million in the prior year period. This $353 million change was due to a base period charge of $152 million for legislation, which changed the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments, as well as a more favorable current year effective tax rate due to a favorable mix of earnings. Net earnings fiscal year to date increased $975 million due to the net impact of discrete adjustments to reserves for uncertain income tax positions, favorable settlement of a value added tax audit, lower current period restructuring-type spending and a more favorable current year effective tax rate due to a more favorable mix of earnings. Net discrete adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions benefited current year by $424 million, while prior year adjustments reduced earnings by $86 million, including the aforementioned base period charge of $152 million. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated $9.4 billion from operating activities during the fiscal year to date period. This represents a 26% decline versus the prior year period primarily due to higher levels of cash invested in working capital. On a year-to-date basis, working capital consumed $1.5 billion primarily behind higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Accounts receivable used $495 million to support business growth and as a result of disproportionately higher sales in the last month of the quarter. Inventory consumed $817 million driven by higher commodity costs, initiative activity, business growth, and increased safety stock levels behind customer service improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $223 million primarily to satisfy marketing and capital commitments accrued for at the end of the 2010 fiscal year. Other operating assets and liabilities resulted in a reconciling use of $797 million mainly due to favorable adjustments of net liabilities for unrecognized tax positions, which did not provide cash. Investing Activities We invested $2.4 billion to support capital expenditures and our net acquisition and divestiture activities in the current period. Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion or 3.3% of net sales. We expect capital expenditures of approximately 4% of net sales for the fiscal year. Acquisitions consumed $489 million mainly due to the purchase of Ambi Pur, while proceeds from asset sales were primarily driven by the Zest divestiture in North America. Prior-year cash generated from investing activities was $1.0 billion, as normal ongoing capital investments was more than offset by proceeds from divestitures driven by the sale of the global pharmaceuticals business in October 2009. Financing Activities We utilized $7.1 billion for financing activities. We continued to return cash to shareholders by purchasing $4.5 billion of treasury stock and paying $4.2 billion in dividends. We received $928 million primarily behind the proceeds from additional debt issuances. We expect to repurchase a total of $6 - $8 billion of treasury stock during fiscal 2011. In the prior year period, we consumed $13.5 billion to fund financing activities, primarily due to debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. As of March 31, 2011, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.4 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the January - March quarter: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the fiscal year to date period: Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS: This is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding a charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the U.S. healthcare reform legislation in the prior year period, charges related to pending European legal matters for current and prior years, and a significant adjustment to an income tax reserve related to the deductibility of technology donations in prior years. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations Charge for Taxation of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations Significant Adjustment to Income Tax Reserve Charges for Pending European Legal Matters Charge for Taxation of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy Note – All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Free Cash Flow Productivity Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2010. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on pages 48-49, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 59-62 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and taxes. As previously reported, the Company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. Those that are pending include investigations by national authorities in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, and Romania. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Although non-monetary sanctions are not being sought in any of these matters, competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In cases in other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed, several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. During the most recent quarter, authorities in Spain and the Czech Republic issued final decisions, and in April 2011, the European Commission also issued a final decision. All of these decisions resulted in monetary penalties, for which the Company had previously accrued sufficient financial reserves. The ultimate resolution of the remaining matters listed above may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. Please refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). Risk Factors. For a discussion of the Company’s risk factors, please refer to Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2010.

This includes 64,213 shares acquired by the Company under various compensation and benefit plans. All transactions were made in the open market or pursuant to prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company prepays large financial institutions to deliver shares at future dates in exchange for a discount. This table excludes shares withheld from employees to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements on option exercises and other equity-based transactions. The Company administers cashless exercises through an independent third party and does not repurchase stock in connection with a cashless exercise. Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission. On August 3, 2010, the Company announced a share repurchase plan to acquire $6 to $8 billion of Company common stock during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011 in open market and/or private transactions. This repurchase plan was authorized pursuant to a resolution issued by the Company’s Board of Directors and is expected to be financed by issuing a combination of long-term and short-term debt. Certain purchases were made prior to the announcement of the plan but are considered purchases against the plan. The dollar values listed in this column include commissions to be paid to brokers to execute the transactions.

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For details on the Company’s risk management activities and fair value measurement policies under the fair value hierarchy, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Fair Value Hierarchy The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of September 30 and June 30, 2011 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: 6 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Amounts in millions September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 Assets at fair value: Investment securities $ 10 $ 16 $ — $ — $ 23 $ 23 $ 33 $ 39 Derivatives relating to: Foreign currency hedges — — — 1 — — — 1 Other foreign currency instruments (1) — — 49 182 — — 49 182 Interest rates — — 295 163 — — 295 163 Net investment hedges — — 5 — — — 5 — Commodities — — 3 4 — — 3 4 Total assets at fair value (2) 10 16 352 350 23 23 385 389 Liabilities at fair value: Derivatives relating to: Foreign currency hedges — — 174 119 — — 174 119 Other foreign currency instruments (1) — — 361 43 — — 361 43 Net investment hedges — — 182 138 — — 182 138 Commodities — — 3 1 — — 3 1 Total liabilities at fair value (3) — — 720 301 — — 720 301 (1) Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. (2) Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent assets. (3) All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of September 30, 2011 was $504 million . The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $24,807 million and $23,418 million at September 30 and June 30, 2011, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is and has been subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions 9 were taken. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The remaining authorities' investigations are in various stages of the regulatory process. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of the complaints, as well as final decisions issued by authorities in a number of countries, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations totaling $283 million as of September 30, 2011. While the ultimate resolution of the matters for which we have accrued liabilities may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. For our other remaining competition law matters, at this time, there are none that we consider reasonably possible to result in fines that are probable and estimable and we cannot reasonably estimate any additional fines to which the Company may be subject. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months related to audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of P&G’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results • Forward-Looking Statements • Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 • Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 • Financial Condition • Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash 10 flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. OVERVIEW The purpose of our business is to provide branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. This will enable us to execute our Purpose-inspired growth strategy: to touch and improve more consumers' lives, in more parts of the world, more completely. We believe this will result in leadership sales, earnings and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate-often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides more information about the components of our reportable business segment structure. Reportable Segment Categories Billion Dollar Brands Beauty Cosmetics, Female Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Female Personal Cleansing, Female Shave Care, Hair Care, Hair Color, Hair Styling, Pharmacy Channel, Prestige Products, Salon Professional, Skin Care Head & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, Wella Grooming Electronic Hair Removal Devices, Small Home Appliances, Male Blades and Razors, Male Personal Care Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Health Care Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Water Filtration, Other Oral Care Always, Crest, Oral-B Snacks and Pet Care Pet Care, Snacks Iams, Pringles Fabric Care and Home Care Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Gain, Tide, Febreze Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2011 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): 11 Three Months Ended September 30 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 24 % 24 % Grooming 9 % 14 % Health Care 15 % 18 % Snacks and Pet Care 4 % 2 % Fabric Care and Home Care 30 % 26 % Baby Care and Family Care 18 % 16 % Total 100 % 100 % SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2011: • Net sales increased 9% to $21.9 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 4%. • Unit volume grew 1%, led by mid-single-digit growth in the developing regions and the Beauty Care segment. • Net earnings were $3.0 billion, a decrease of 2% versus the prior year period as sales growth was more than offset by gross margin contraction driven primarily by higher commodity costs. • Diluted net earnings per share increased 1% to $1.03. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. • Operating cash flow decreased 12% versus the prior year period to $2.2 billion mainly due to an increase in working capital. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $1.3 billion. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 44%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements,"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q. Ability to Achieve Business Plans . We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers, and to maintain security over our data. Cost Pressures . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must 12 manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions . Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters, such as the civil unrest in the Middle East and the impacts of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions, and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Regulatory Environment . Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2011 versus the three months ended September 30, 2010. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information 13 Three Months Ended September 30 2011 2010 % CHG NET SALES $ 21,917 $ 20,122 9% COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD 11,061 9,689 14% GROSS MARGIN 10,856 10,433 4% SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 6,522 5,932 10% OPERATING INCOME 4,334 4,501 (4)% TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 207 208 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET (32 ) (11 ) EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 4,095 4,282 (4)% INCOME TAXES 1,071 1,201 NET EARNINGS 3,024 3,081 (2)% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 26.2 % 28.0 % PER COMMON SHARE: BASIC NET EARNINGS $ 1.08 $ 1.07 1% DILUTED NET EARNINGS $ 1.03 $ 1.02 1% DIVIDENDS $ 0.525 $ 0.4818 9% AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,945.8 3,025.6 COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES Basis Pt Chg GROSS MARGIN 49.5 % 51.9 % (240 ) SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 29.7 % 29.5 % 20 OPERATING MARGIN 19.8 % 22.4 % (260 ) EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 18.7 % 21.3 % (260 ) NET EARNINGS 13.8 % 15.3 % (150 ) Net sales increased 9% to $21.9 billion for the July - September quarter on a 1% increase in unit volume. Volume grew across four of the six business segments. Beauty Care grew mid-single digits, with Health Care, Snacks and Pet Care, and Baby Care and Family Care growing low single digits. Grooming volume was in line with the prior year period, while Fabric Care and Home Care volume was down low single digits. Volume grew mid-single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, increased 2%. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions to offset commodity costs. Negative mix reduced net sales by 1% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 5% as key foreign currencies strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth was 4% driven by unit volume growth and price increases, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2011 vs. 2010 (Three Months Ended Sep.30) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix/Other Net Sales Growth Beauty 4 % 5 % 6 % 2 % -3 % 9 % Grooming 0 % 0 % 7 % 2 % 1 % 10 % Health Care 3 % 3 % 6 % 3 % -2 % 10 % Snacks and Pet Care 2 % 2 % 5 % 2 % 0 % 9 % Fabric Care and Home Care -1 % -1 % 5 % 5 % -3 % 6 % Baby Care and Family Care 2 % 2 % 5 % 4 % 1 % 12 % TOTAL COMPANY 1 % 2 % 5 % 4 % -1 % 9 % Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. 14 Gross margin contracted 240 basis points to 49.5% of net sales in the first fiscal quarter. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 340 basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs, along with negative product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products. These impacts were partially offset by a 140 basis point impact from pricing, as well as manufacturing cost savings, and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 10% to $6.5 billion, driven by higher marketing and overhead spending to support growth, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points in the first quarter to 29.7% driven by higher marketing spending, partially offset by overhead scale leverage from increased sales. Interest expense was $207 million for the quarter, down $1 million versus the prior year period due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income/(expense) declined $21 million mainly behind lower interest and investment income and higher provisions for minority interests due to increased earnings in less than fully-owned subsidiaries. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 180 basis points to 26.2% primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings, as an increased proportion of current year earnings were generated in foreign markets with lower tax rates versus the U.S. Net earnings decreased 2% to $3.0 billion for the quarter as the net sales increase was more than offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined 260 basis points due to gross margin contraction and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share increased 1% to $1.03. Earnings per share growth exceeded net earnings growth due to the impact of share repurchase activity. Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is now the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has a number of currency controls for companies operating in Venezuela. There is one official exchange rate for imported goods, equal to 4.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate, which is also expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. There are also exchange controls over securities transactions in what was the parallel market, which has historically been used to pay for imported goods and services that do not qualify for exchange in the official market and is now controlled by authorities. The Central Bank of Venezuela is currently the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI (4.3 rate) through the SITME rate which was approximately 5.3 as of September 30, 2011. The notional amount of transactions that run through this foreign exchange rate for non-essential goods is restrictive, which for us has essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the CADIVI (4.3) rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. As of September 30, 2011, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $782 million. Approximately $325 million of this balance has been remeasured using the SITME rate because we plan to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans and the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors, we have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official and parallel exchange rates on the portion of our local monetary assets reflected at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors, including the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 15 The following discussion provides a review of results by business segment. Analyses of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2011 are provided compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2010. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings from continuing operations. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2011 versus the comparable prior year period (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 5,390 9 % $ 991 (8 )% $ 731 (12 )% Grooming 2,093 10 % 576 10 % 438 10 % Health Care 3,291 10 % 800 8 % 542 9 % Snacks and Pet Care 776 9 % 90 17 % 62 15 % Fabric Care and Home Care 6,681 6 % 1,263 (11 )% 805 (14 )% Baby Care and Family Care 4,079 12 % 792 6 % 494 5 % Corporate (393 ) N/A (417 ) N/A (48 ) N/A Total Company 21,917 9 % 4,095 (4 )% 3,024 (2 )% Beauty Beauty net sales increased 9% to $5.4 billion on unit volume growth of 4%. Organic sales grew 4% on 5% organic volume growth. Price increases contributed 2% to net sales growth. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 3% behind disproportionate growth in developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices, and a decrease in the premium-priced Salon Professional category. Favorable foreign exchange added 6% to net sales growth. Volume increased high single digits in developing regions and low single digits in developed regions. Volume in Retail Hair Care grew high single digits behind double-digit growth in developing regions led by Pantene initiatives and Head & Shoulders geographic expansion. Global market share of the hair care category was up over half a point. Volume in Female Beauty decreased mid-single digits due to the Zest and Infasil divestitures, as well as a decrease in Olay due to share loss from competitive activity in North America, and a decrease in the CEEMEA region due to a reduction in customer inventories following relatively high shipments in the June quarter and comparing against a high base period. Volume in Salon Professional was down high single digits mainly due to market size contractions and competitive activity. Volume in Prestige Products increased double digits driven by initiatives across Gucci, Hugo, and Lacoste. Net earnings decreased 12% to $731 million, as higher net sales were more than offset by a 320-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to gross margin contraction and higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and higher pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing and overhead spending to support growth. Grooming Grooming net sales increased 10% to $2.1 billion. Volume was in line with prior year. Organic sales were up 3%. Price increases contributed 2% to net sales growth. Positive product mix increased net sales by 1% mainly due to ProGlide and premium appliances initiatives, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales growth by 7%. Volume grew low single digits in developing regions and decreased low single digits in developed regions. Volume in Male Grooming was up low single digits due to growth of blades and razors in Asia and Latin America, as well as growth behind male personal care products in North America, partially offset by a decrease in Western Europe blades and razors due to market softness. Global market share of the blades and razors category was unchanged. Volume in Appliances decreased high single digits due to market contraction in Western Europe and a strong base period for shavers, epilators, and hair care appliances. Global market share of the dry shave category was down over 3 points. Net earnings increased 10% to $438 million behind higher net sales. Net earnings margin was in line with the prior year period, with gross margin contraction offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity costs, partially offset by price increases. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to scale leverage from increased sales. Health Care 16 Health Care net sales increased 10% to $3.3 billion on 3% growth in unit volume. Organic sales were up 4%. Price increases contributed 3% to net sales growth. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 2% behind geographic and product mix, due to disproportionate growth in countries and products with lower than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales growth by 6%. Volume increased low single digits in both developing and developed regions. Volume in Oral Care increased mid-single digits behind the expansion of Oral-B toothpaste in Western Europe and Latin America, and toothbrush initiatives in Asia. Global market share of the oral care category was up nearly half a point. Volume in Personal Health Care increased low single digits behind higher shipments of Vicks, primarily in North America and Asia, due to initiative activity, partially offset by lower shipments of Prilosec OTC in North America due to non-branded competitive activity. All-outlet value share of the U.S. personal health care market increased about half a point. Volume in Feminine Care was up low single digits primarily due to new products in China and strong growth in India. Global market share of the feminine care category was down less than half a point. Net earnings increased 9% to $542 million as higher net sales were partially offset by a 10-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to gross margin contraction, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and price increases. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to scale leverage from increased sales. Snacks and Pet Care Snacks and Pet Care net sales increased 9% to $776 million on a 2% increase in unit volume. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange increased 4%. Price increases added 2% to net sales growth. Favorable foreign exchange positively impacted net sales growth by 5%. Snacks volume increased high single digits mainly due to increased distribution and market growth in developing regions, as well as share growth and market growth in North America. Global market share of the snacks category was up slightly. Pet Care volume was down mid-single digits due mainly to customer inventory adjustments in North America related to the June price increase. Global market share of the pet care category was down approximately half a point. Net earnings increased 15% to $62 million due to sales growth and a 30-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased as a lower gross margin was more than fully offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined behind higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to scale leverage from increased sales. In April 2011, we announced plans to divest the Company's Snacks business through a merger with Diamond Foods, Inc. in an all-stock Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The Snacks business had net sales of approximately $1.5 billion and operating income of approximately $200 million in fiscal 2011. The Company expects the transaction to close by the end of the 2011 calendar year, pending necessary regulatory approvals. Fabric Care and Home Care Fabric Care and Home Care net sales increased 6% to $6.7 billion, despite a 1% decrease in unit volume. Organic sales were up 1%. Price increases contributed 5% to net sales growth. Mix negatively impacted net sales growth by 3% due to disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines and developing regions, which have lower than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 5%. Volume in developing regions grew mid-single digits, while volume in developed regions decreased mid-single digits. Fabric Care volume decreased low single digits mainly due to initiative activity in the base period and the impact of the forward buy in the previous quarter ahead of the price increases in North America, partially offset by growth in Asia. Global market share of the fabric care category decreased half a point. Home Care volume decreased low single digits driven by the impact of the forward buy in the previous quarter ahead of the price increases in North America, partially offset by initiative activity and distribution expansion in developing regions. Global market share of the home care category was unchanged. Batteries volume grew low single digits primarily due to market growth in developing regions and increased demand following the hurricane in North America. Global market share of the batteries category increased more than half a point. Net earnings decreased 14% to $805 million as net sales growth was more than offset by a 280-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased mainly due to gross margin contraction and a higher effective tax rate. Gross margin decreased mainly due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and pricing. The tax rate increased due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings to countries with higher statutory tax rates. Baby Care and Family Care Baby Care and Family Care net sales increased 12% to $4.1 billion on 2% volume growth. Organic sales were up 7%. Pricing added 4% to net sales growth. Mix increased net sales by 1% due to disproportionate growth of Baby Care, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales growth by 5%. Volume grew double 17 digits in developing regions and decreased low single digits in developed regions. Volume in Baby Care was up high single digits behind market size growth and distribution expansion in developing regions, partially offset by diaper market softness in North America and Western Europe. Global market share of the baby care category increased over 1 point. Volume in Family Care decreased mid-single digits primarily due to the impact of the forward buy in the previous quarter ahead of the price increases in North America. In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category increased slightly. Net earnings increased 5% to $494 million as sales growth was partially offset by an 80-basis point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin declined mainly due to a lower gross margin. The reduction in gross margin was driven by higher commodity costs, partially offset by the impact of higher pricing. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally a negative balance. In 2011, negative net sales in Corporate increased by $46 million due to increased adjustments required to eliminate higher sales of unconsolidated entities. Net Corporate expenses decreased $54 million, primarily due to net tax impacts. Additional discussion of the items impacting net income in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operating activities in our first fiscal quarter. This represents a decline of 12% versus the prior year period primarily due to higher levels of working capital. On a year-to-date basis, the net of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable consumed $2.0 billion of cash. Accounts receivable used $639 million of cash primarily due to increased sales later in the quarter, growth in regions and categories with longer average payment terms, extension of trade terms in the Respiratory business and to support overall business growth. Inventory consumed $927 million of cash, mainly to support product initiatives, holiday-related shipments in some of our seasonal businesses, and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $479 million of cash, primarily related to the payment of prior-year marketing accruals and the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Investing Activities Our investing activities consumed cash of $859 million mainly to fund capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $833 million or 3.8% of net sales. Cash used for investing activities decreased $69 million versus the prior year period mainly due to reduced net cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. Financing Activities Our financing activities consumed net cash of $419 million. We used $1.3 billion for treasury stock purchases and $1.5 billion for dividends and partially funded these cash outlays through the issuance of $2.0 billion of long-term debt. Cash consumed by financing activities declined $1.5 billion versus the prior year period due to increased levels of debt and a decrease in the treasury stock purchases. 18 As of September 30, 2011, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.8 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales for the July - September quarter: Jul - Sep 2011 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact* Organic Sales Growth Beauty 9 % (6 )% 1 % 4 % Grooming 10 % (7 )% — % 3 % Health Care 10 % (6 )% — % 4 % Snacks and Pet Care 9 % (5 )% — % 4 % Fabric Care and Home Care 6 % (5 )% — % 1 % Baby Care and Family Care 12 % (5 )% — % 7 % Total P&G 9 % (5 )% — % 4 % * Acquisition/Divestiture Impacts includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90% of net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Free Cash Flow Productivity Jul - Sept ‘11 $2,167 $(833) $1,334 $3,024 44% 19 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2011. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on page 50, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 60-62 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. As previously reported, the Company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed, several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. The Company resolved several of these matters prior to the most recent quarter. Those that remain open include investigations by national authorities in Belgium, France, Germany and Greece. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Competition and antitrust violations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. No non-monetary sanctions are being sought in these matters. There were no new developments on those remaining investigations during the most recent quarter. For certain of the remaining matters listed above, we have established accruals for potential fines. We do not expect any significant incremental fines or costs in excess of amounts accrued for these matters. For other remaining matters, we cannot reasonably estimate any fines to which the Company may be subject as a result of these competition law matters. Please refer to the Company's Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company’s European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company’s local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company’s European affiliate(s). Item 1A. Risk Factors. 20 We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, other quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures and risks inherent in global manufacturing which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. In addition, we are subject to risks inherent in global manufacturing, such as environmental events, labor disputes, disruption in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued 21 global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers, or we are unable to maintain trademark protection. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. Our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in total, may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Moreover, as a U.S. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, retail trade consolidation could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. 22 Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. We could also be negatively impacted by an economic crisis in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness or a default by local governments. Such events could negatively impact our overall liquidity, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including email and internet sites, as well as hardware, software and other applications, some of which are managed, hosted, or used by third-parties, to conduct our business. The various uses of these systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, and research information, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, sharing confidential information, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security, and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of annual results. 2. Comprehensive Income - Total comprehensive income is comprised primarily of net earnings, net currency translation gains and losses, impacts of net investment and cash flow hedges, net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and defined benefit and other retiree benefit plan activities. Total comprehensive income for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $334 million and $3,013 million , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, total comprehensive income was $450 million and $8,948 million , respectively. 3. Segment Information - Effective during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty and Grooming GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Beauty reportable segment and are now included in the Grooming reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Grooming reportable segment to the Beauty reportable segment. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. Following is a summary of segment results.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill as of December 31, 2011, is allocated by reportable segment as follows (amounts in millions): Beauty Grooming Health Care Snacks and Pet Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Corporate Total Company GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2011 $ 18,039 $ 22,650 $ 8,179 $ 2,243 $ 4,589 $ 1,553 $ 309 $ 57,562 Acquisitions and divestitures (1 ) (4 ) 417 — (1 ) — — 411 Goodwill Impairment charges (433 ) (875 ) — — — — — (1,308 ) Translation and other (959 ) (877 ) (257 ) (14 ) (169 ) (82 ) — (2,358 ) GOODWILL at DECEMBER 31, 2011 $ 16,646 $ 20,894 $ 8,339 $ 2,229 $ 4,419 $ 1,471 $ 309 $ 54,307 During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 of 5 each year. This change was made to better align the timing of our annual impairment testing with the timing of the Company's annual strategic planning process. We believe this change is preferable because it allows us to more efficiently utilize the reporting units' long-term financial projections, which are generated from the annual strategic planning process, as the basis for performing our annual impairment testing. This change does not result in any delay, acceleration or avoidance of impairment, nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements. This change was applied prospectively beginning on October 1, 2011; retrospective application to prior periods is impracticable as the Company is unable to objectively determine, without the use of hindsight, the assumptions that would have been used in those earlier periods. We also test our indefinite lived intangibles for impairment during the second fiscal quarter of each year, and accordingly performed this testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011. We tested goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2011 (the testing date under our previous policy) and no impairments were indicated. Our goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2011 (the testing date under our new policy) determined that certain goodwill amounts were impaired. Specifically, the results of our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. As a result of our impairment testing, we recorded an estimated noncash before and after tax impairment charge of $1,308 million to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for these units to estimated fair value- $875 million related to Appliances and $433 million related to Salon Professional. Following the impairment charges, the carrying values of the goodwill of Appliances and Salon Professional were $638 million and $420 million , respectively. Our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, also indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a noncash before tax impairment charge of $246 million ( $173 million after tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values. Following the impairment charges, the carrying values of the Koleston Perfect and Wella trade names were $308 million and $605 million , respectively. To determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles, we use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of the business, and is most consistent with the approach a market-place participant would use. Under this approach, we estimate the future cash flows of the respective reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets and discount those cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of each business. The declines in the fair value of the Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units and the underlying Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangibles were driven by a combination of similar competitive and economic factors, which are resulting in a reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value. These factors include; (1) A more prolonged and deeper deterioration of the macroeconomic environment than was previously expected which, due to the more discretionary nature of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, is leading to a reduction in the overall market size in the short term and a more significant and prolonged reduction in the expected underlying market growth rates and resulting sales levels in the longer term. This is particularly evident in Europe, which is where we have historically generated a majority of the Appliances and Salon Professional sales. (2) Increasing competitive levels of innovation in Salon Professional is negatively impacting our current and nearer-term projected market share progress. (3) An increasing level of competitive pricing activities is negatively impacting pricing levels and lowering overall category profitability. As a result of these factors, we have recently reduced our current and longer-term sales and earnings forecasts for these businesses. All of the impairment charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting. The second step of the goodwill impairment evaluations have not yet been finalized. Accordingly, the impairments recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, are based on preliminary estimates. We expect to finalize these impairment evaluations during the quarter ended March 31, 2012. Any potential adjustments to the Company's preliminary estimates as a result of completing these evaluations, which could be significant, will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements when finalized. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuation. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used in our valuations, we may need to record additional non cash impairment charges in the future. 6 In addition to the impairment charges, goodwill also decreased from June 30, 2011, due to currency translation across reportable segments and the divestiture of PUR, the water filtration brand, in our Health Care reportable segment. These decreases were partially offset by the establishment of goodwill related to the previously disclosed business combination with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries in our Health Care reportable segment. Identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2011, are comprised of (amounts in millions): Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortizable intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,836 $ 4,351 Intangible assets with indefinite lives 26,840 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 35,676 $ 4,351 Amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of brands. The amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $123 million and $132 million , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amortization of intangible assets was $251 million and $272 million , respectively. 5. Share-Based Compensation - Pursuant to applicable accounting guidance for share-based payments, companies must recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. Total share-based compensation for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2011 2010 2011 2010 Share-Based Compensation Stock options $ 76 $ 85 $ 138 $ 153 Other share-based awards 12 8 30 27 Total share-based compensation $ 88 $ 93 $ 168 $ 180 Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. 6. Postretirement Benefits - The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. The components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans are as follows: Pension Benefits Other Retiree Benefits Three Months Ended December 31 Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions 2011 2010 2011 2010 Service cost $ 63 $ 64 $ 35 $ 35 Interest cost 152 144 69 66 Expected return on plan assets (142 ) (122 ) (108 ) (107 ) Amortization of deferred amounts 5 5 (5 ) (5 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 26 38 24 23 Gross benefit cost (credit) 104 129 15 12 Dividends on ESOP preferred stock — — (18 ) (19 ) Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ 104 $ 129 $ (3 ) $ (7 ) 7 Pension Benefits Other Retiree Benefits Six Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions 2011 2010 2011 2010 Service cost $ 130 $ 126 $ 71 $ 70 Interest cost 309 284 138 131 Expected return on plan assets (288 ) (241 ) (216 ) (215 ) Amortization of deferred amounts 11 9 (10 ) (10 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 52 75 49 47 Gross benefit cost (credit) 214 253 32 23 Dividends on ESOP preferred stock — — (37 ) (39 ) Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ 214 $ 253 $ (5 ) $ (16 ) For the year ending June 30, 2012, the expected return on plan assets is 7.4% and 9.2% for defined benefit and other retiree benefit plans, respectively. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For details on the Company’s risk management activities and fair value measurement policies under the fair value hierarchy, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Fair Value Hierarchy The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities as of December 31 and June 30, 2011 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Amounts in millions December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 Assets at fair value: Investment securities $ 7 $ 16 $ — $ — $ 22 $ 23 $ 29 $ 39 Derivatives relating to: Foreign currency hedges — — — 1 — — — 1 Other foreign currency instruments (1) — — 30 182 — — 30 182 Interest rates — — 275 163 — — 275 163 Net investment hedges — — 6 — — — 6 — Commodities — — 1 4 — — 1 4 Total assets at fair value (2) 7 16 312 350 22 23 341 389 Liabilities at fair value: Derivatives relating to: Foreign currency hedges — — 169 119 — — 169 119 Other foreign currency instruments (1) — — 272 43 — — 272 43 Net investment hedges — — 70 138 — — 70 138 Commodities — — — 1 — — — 1 Total liabilities at fair value (3) — — 511 301 — — 511 301 (1) Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. (2) Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid 8 expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent assets. (3) All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the goodwill and intangible assets discussed in Note 4, there were no assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Certain of the Company’s financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting agreements with counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangement. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2011 was $377 million . The Company has never been required to post any collateral as a result of these contractual features. Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was $21,950 million and $23,418 million at December 31 and June 30, 2011, respectively. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31 and June 30, 2011 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset (Liability) Amounts in Millions December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 December 31, 2011 June 30, 2011 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Interest rate contracts $ — $ — $ — $ — Foreign currency contracts 831 831 (169 ) (118 ) Commodity contracts 27 16 1 4 Total 858 847 (168 ) (114 ) Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships Interest rate contracts 8,852 10,308 275 163 Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships Net investment hedges 1,809 1,540 (64 ) (138 ) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency contracts 13,811 14,957 (242 ) 139 Commodity contracts 16 39 — (1 ) Total 13,827 14,996 (242 ) 138 The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative of the level of the Company’s derivative activity during the period.

The amounts of gains and losses on qualifying and non-qualifying financial instruments used in hedging transactions for the three and six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income (1) Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in Millions 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Interest rate contracts $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 $ 4 Foreign currency contracts 18 (19 ) (27 ) (68 ) Commodity contracts — 4 1 18 Total 19 (13 ) (23 ) (46 ) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in Millions 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships (2) Interest rate contracts (19 ) (87 ) 112 (25 ) Debt 19 89 (114 ) 26 Total — 2 (2 ) 1 Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships (2) Net investment hedges (5 ) (1 ) (8 ) (1 ) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (3) Foreign currency contracts (4) (410 ) (110 ) (991 ) 626 Commodity contracts — 2 (1 ) 4 Total (410 ) (108 ) (992 ) 630 (1) The gain or loss on the effective portion of cash flow hedging relationships is reclassified from accumulated OCI into net income in the same period during which the related item affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: interest rate contracts in interest expense, foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and interest expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. (2) The gain or loss on the ineffective portion of interest rate contracts and net investment hedges, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in interest expense. (3) The gain or loss on contracts not designated as hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows: foreign currency contracts in selling, general and administrative expense and commodity contracts in cost of products sold. (4) The gain or loss on non-qualifying foreign currency contracts substantially offsets the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. 8. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we elected to revise our Consolidated Statements of Earnings to present separately the net expense for earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. As previously disclosed, this net expense has not historically been presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings due to immateriality, but has been reflected within other non-operating income/(expense). The historical Consolidated Statements of Earnings has been revised to conform to the new presentation, with a corresponding change to the ""net earnings"" line item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This change did not impact our historically reported net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble or the historical basic or diluted net earnings per share balances, nor did it impact total operating cash flows. However, it did impact certain amounts within those statements. The amount reclassified to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the 10 six months ended December 31, 2010, totaling $68 million , had an offsetting impact on other non-operating income/(expense) within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and on ""changes in other operating assets and liabilitites"" within Operating Activities of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with this change, we also made a change to prior year Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow amounts to appropriately classify dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. Such dividends had historically been included in ""changes in other operating assets and liabilities"" within Operating Activities of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These dividend payments ( $47 million for the six months ended December 31, 2010) were reclassified to ""impact of stock options and other"" within Financing Activities of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The above changes were made in order to provide additional transparency related to noncontrolling interests by segregating them from the ongoing operating activities attributable to shareholders of the company. No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, income taxes and other actions. As previously disclosed, the Company is and has been subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company has identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate complaints pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The remaining authorities' investigations are in various stages of the regulatory process. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of the complaints, as well as a final decision issued during the quarter by authorities in France for a laundry detergent investigation, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations totaling $335 million as of December 31, 2011. While the ultimate resolution of the matters for which we have accrued liabilities may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. For our other remaining competition law matters, we cannot reasonably estimate any additional fines to which the Company may be subject as a result of the investigations. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 – 60 audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, 11 including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months related to audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble’s financial results and condition by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results • Forward-Looking Statements • Results of Operations – Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 • Results of Operations – Six Months Ended December 31, 2011 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2011 • Financial Condition • Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. OVERVIEW The purpose of our business is to provide branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. This will enable us to execute our Purpose-inspired growth strategy: to touch and improve more consumers' lives, in more parts of the world, more completely. We believe this will result in leadership sales, earnings and value creation, allowing employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 80 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate-often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Effective during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of 12 the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Beauty reportable segment and are now included in the Grooming reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Grooming reportable segment to the Beauty reportable segment. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. The table below provides more information about the components of our reportable business segment structure. Reportable Segment Categories Billion Dollar Brands Beauty Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Hair Care, Hair Color, Hair Styling, Personal Cleansing, Prestige Products, Salon Professional, Skin Care Head & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, Wella Grooming Blades and Razors, Electronic Hair Removal Devices, Shave Products, Home Small Appliances Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Health Care Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care Always, Crest, Oral-B Snacks and Pet Care Pet Care, Snacks Iams, Pringles Fabric Care and Home Care Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Gain, Tide, Febreze Baby Care and Family Care Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended December 31, 2011 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended December 31 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 24 % 26 % Grooming 10 % 16 % Health Care 14 % 17 % Snacks and Pet Care 4 % 2 % Fabric Care and Home Care 29 % 23 % Baby Care and Family Care 19 % 16 % Total 100 % 100 % The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the six months ended December 31, 2011 (excludes net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Six Months Ended December 31 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 24 % 24 % Grooming 10 % 16 % Health Care 14 % 17 % Snacks and Pet Care 4 % 2 % Fabric Care and Home Care 30 % 25 % Baby Care and Family Care 18 % 16 % Total 100 % 100 % SUMMARY OF RESULTS 13 Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2011 versus the six months ended December 31, 2010: • Net sales increased 6% to $44.1 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, were up 4%. • Unit volume grew 1%, with low single digit growth for Beauty, Health, Grooming, Snacks and Pet Care, and Baby Care and Family Care. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $4.7 billion, a decrease of 27% versus the prior year period as sales growth was more than offset by non-core charges and gross margin contraction. The non-core charges included $1.6 billion of before tax non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses. The decline in gross margin was driven primarily by higher commodity costs. • Diluted net earnings per share decreased 25% to $1.60. Earnings per share decline is different from net earnings decline due to the impact of share repurchase activity. • Operating cash flow for fiscal year to date increased 2% to $5.5 billion. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $3.7 billion. Free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 78%. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements,"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q. Ability to Achieve Business Plans . We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers, and to maintain security over our data. Cost Pressures . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions . Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters, such as the civil unrest in the Middle East and the impacts of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including 14 sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions, and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Regulatory Environment . Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2011 versus the three months ended December 31, 2010. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information Three Months Ended December 31 2011 2010 % CHG NET SALES $ 22,135 $ 21,347 4 % COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD 11,125 10,287 8 % GROSS PROFIT 11,010 11,060 — % SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 6,717 6,800 (1 )% GOODWILL & INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 1,554 — OPERATING INCOME 2,739 4,260 (36 )% TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 201 209 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET 170 39 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 2,708 4,090 (34 )% INCOME TAXES 995 728 NET EARNINGS 1,713 3,362 (49 )% LESS: NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 23 29 (21 )% NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE 1,690 3,333 (49 )% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 36.7 % 17.8 % PER COMMON SHARE: BASIC NET EARNINGS (1) $ 0.59 $ 1.17 (50 )% DILUTED NET EARNINGS (1) $ 0.57 $ 1.11 (49 )% DIVIDENDS $ 0.525 $ 0.4818 9 % AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,949.7 3,000.2 (1) Basic net earnings per share and diluted net earnings per share are calculated on net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES Basis Pt Chg GROSS MARGIN 49.7 % 51.8 % (210 ) SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 30.3 % 31.8 % (150 ) OPERATING MARGIN 12.4 % 20.0 % (760 ) EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 12.2 % 19.2 % (700 ) NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE 7.6 % 15.6 % (800 ) 15 Net sales increased 4% to $22.1 billion for the October - December quarter on a 1% increase in unit volume. Volume was in line with the prior year or grew across all six of the business segments. Snacks and Pet Care, Beauty and Grooming grew volume low single digits. Health Care, Fabric Care and Home Care, and Baby Care and Family Care volume was in line with the prior year period. Volume grew high single digits in developing regions and was down mid-single digits in developed regions. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions primarily to offset commodity cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies. Negative mix reduced net sales by 1% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Organic sales growth was 4% driven by unit volume growth and price increases, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable mix. Net Sales Change Drivers 2011 vs. 2010 (Three Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix/Other Net Sales Growth Beauty 1 % 2 % 1 % 3 % -4 % 1 % Grooming 1 % 1 % 0 % 2 % -2 % 1 % Health Care 0 % 0 % 0 % 3 % -2 % 1 % Snacks and Pet Care 2 % 2 % 0 % 3 % -2 % 3 % Fabric Care and Home Care 0 % 0 % 0 % 6 % -1 % 5 % Baby Care and Family Care 0 % 0 % 0 % 6 % 0 % 6 % TOTAL COMPANY 1 % 1 % 0 % 4 % -1 % 4 % Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin contracted 210 basis points to 49.7% of net sales for the quarter. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 280 basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by over 200 basis points from negative product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products. These impacts were partially offset by a 190 basis point impact from increased pricing, as well as manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 1% to $6.7 billion, driven by a decrease in overhead spending, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending. Overhead spending decreased due to lower competition law fines, which declined from $305 million in the prior period to $66 million in the current period. Marketing spending increased primarily due to increased investments to support innovation and expansion plans. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 150 basis points to 30.3%. Both overhead spending and marketing spending declined as a percentage of net sales due to scale leverage from an increase in net sales. During the quarter we recorded a total of $1,554 million ($1,481 million after tax), in non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The charges related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. With respect to the indefinite lived intangible assets, for management reporting purposes, the underlying impairment charges were excluded from business unit earnings and included in Corporate. Accordingly, these charges were also included in Corporate for segment reporting. Interest expense was $201 million for the quarter, down $8 million versus the prior year period due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income/(expense) increased $131 million mainly behind the divestiture gain from our PUR business. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 1,890 basis points to 36.7% primarily as a result of 1) a 1,170 basis points impact from non-deductibility of the impairment charges in the current year period and 2) the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 930 basis points in the prior year and 170 basis points in the current year). These impacts were partially offset by an 80 basis point benefit from non-taxable divestiture gains in the current year period. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased 49% to $1.7 billion for the quarter as the net sales increase was more than offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined 760 basis points due to a 700 basis point impact from 16 goodwill and intangible impairment charges and the 210 basis point gross margin contraction, partially offset by a 150 basis point decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 49% to $0.57. Foreign Currency Translation – Venezuela Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is now the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has a number of currency controls for companies operating in Venezuela. There is one official exchange rate for imported goods, equal to 4.3 bolivars to one U.S. dollar. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate, which is also expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. There are also exchange controls over securities transactions in what was the parallel market, which has historically been used to pay for imported goods and services that do not qualify for exchange in the official market and is now controlled by authorities. The Central Bank of Venezuela is currently the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI (4.3 rate) through the SITME rate which was approximately 5.3 as of December 31, 2011. The notional amount of transactions that run through this foreign exchange rate for non-essential goods is restrictive, which for us has essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the CADIVI (4.3) rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. As of December 31, 2011, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $827 million. Approximately $352 million of this balance has been remeasured using the SITME rate because we plan to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans and the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors, we have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official and parallel exchange rates on the portion of our local monetary assets reflected at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors, including the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and consumer spending, the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy and the future state of exchange controls in Venezuela including the availability of U.S. dollars at the official foreign exchange rate. Sales and profit levels in Venezuela could also be impacted by any actions taken by the government under the recently passed law aimed at controlling market prices, which could restrict our ability to take future pricing or force us to freeze or even reduce current pricing levels. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2011 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2011 versus the six months ended December 31, 2010. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Consolidated Earnings Information 17 Six Months Ended December 31 2011 2010 % CHG NET SALES $ 44,052 $ 41,469 6 % COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD 22,186 19,976 11 % GROSS PROFIT 21,866 21,493 2 % SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 13,239 12,732 4 % GOODWILL & INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 1,554 — OPERATING INCOME 7,073 8,761 (19 )% TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 408 417 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET 171 67 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 6,836 8,411 (19 )% INCOME TAXES 2,066 1,929 NET EARNINGS 4,770 6,482 (26 )% LESS: NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 56 68 (18 )% NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE 4,714 6,414 (27 )% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 30.2 % 22.9 % PER COMMON SHARE: BASIC NET EARNINGS (1) $ 1.67 $ 2.24 (25 )% DILUTED NET EARNINGS (1) $ 1.60 $ 2.13 (25 )% DIVIDENDS $ 1.0500 $ 0.9636 9 % AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,946.5 3,013.0 (1) Basic net earnings per share and diluted net earnings per share are calculated on net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble COMPARISONS AS A % OF NET SALES Basis Pt Chg GROSS MARGIN 49.6 % 51.8 % (220 ) SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 30.0 % 30.7 % (70 ) OPERATING MARGIN 16.1 % 21.1 % (500 ) EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 15.5 % 20.3 % (480 ) NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE 10.7 % 15.5 % (480 ) Net sales increased 6% to $44.1 billion fiscal year to date on a 1% increase in unit volume. Volume grew or was in line with the prior period across all six business segments. Beauty Care, Health Care, Grooming, Snacks and Pet Care, and Baby Care and Family Care volume grew low single digits. Fabric Care and Home Care volume was in line with the prior year period. Volume grew high single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions to primarily offset commodity costs and devaluing developing market currencies. Negative mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier value products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 3% as key foreign currencies strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. Organic sales growth was 4% driven by unit volume growth and price increases, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable mix. 18 Net Sales Change Drivers 2011 vs. 2010 (Six Months Ended Dec. 31) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix/Other Net Sales Growth Beauty 3 % 4 % 3 % 2 % -3 % 5 % Grooming 1 % 1 % 3 % 2 % 0 % 6 % Health Care 2 % 1 % 3 % 3 % -2 % 6 % Snacks and Pet Care 2 % 2 % 3 % 2 % -1 % 6 % Fabric Care and Home Care 0 % 0 % 2 % 5 % -2 % 5 % Baby Care and Family Care 1 % 1 % 2 % 5 % 1 % 9 % TOTAL COMPANY 1 % 1 % 3 % 4 % -2 % 6 % Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. Gross margin contracted 220 basis points to 49.6% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 270 basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 240 basis points from negative product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products. These impacts were partially offset by a 160 basis point impact from increased pricing, as well as manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. Total SG&A increased 4% to $13.2 billion, driven by higher marketing and overhead spending to support growth, partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines (which were $306 million in the prior period compared to $65 million in the current period). SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 30.0% driven by scale leverage on overhead costs from increased sales. Interest expense was $408 million for the period, down $9 million versus the prior year period due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income/(expense) increased $104 million mainly behind divestiture gains. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 730 basis points to 30.2% primarily due to a 470 basis points impact from non-deductibility of impairment charges in the current year period and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 450 basis points in the prior year and 130 basis points in the current year). Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased 27% to $4.7 billion as the net sales increase was more than offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin declined 500 basis points due to a 350 basis point impact from goodwill and intangible impairment charges and the 220 basis point gross margin contraction, partially offset by a 70 basis point reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 25% to $1.60. The earnings per share decline is different from the net earnings decline due to the impact of share repurchase activity.

CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost 23 structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; and certain significant impairment charges. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the Company, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate). We also eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests. Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally a negative balance. Negative net sales in Corporate decreased by $87 million in the second fiscal quarter and decreased $41 million fiscal year to date due to adjustments required to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities. Net Corporate expenses increased $1.6 billion in the second fiscal quarter and increased $1.5 billion fiscal year to date primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of $1.5 billion. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year to date period. On a year-to-date basis, the net of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable consumed $2.6 billion of cash. Accounts receivable used $1.1 billion of cash primarily due to increased sales at the end of the period. Inventory consumed $497 million of cash, mainly to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $1,009 million of cash, primarily related to the payment of prior-year marketing accruals and the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $1.5 billion fiscal year to date, a decline of $72 million versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures consumed $1.8 billion or 4.0% of net sales, as compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Cash generated from asset sales was $238 million in the current year, an increase of $216 million mainly due to proceeds from the PUR divestiture. Financing Activities Our financing activities consumed net cash of $2.3 billion. We used $1.8 billion for treasury stock purchases and $3.0 billion for dividends and partially funded these cash outlays through the issuance of $1.9 billion of debt. Cash consumed by financing activities declined $1.3 billion versus the prior year period due to increased levels of debt and a decrease in the treasury stock purchases. As of December 31, 2011, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.1 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items such as acquisitions and share repurchase programs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Our discussion of financial results includes several measures not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about the underlying results and trends of the Company, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. 24 Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company’s long-term target is to generate free cash at or above 90% of net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity is provided below (amounts in millions): Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Free Cash Flow Productivity Jul - Dec ‘11 $5,495 $(1,780) $3,715 $4,770 78% 25 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2011. Additional information can be found in the section entitled Other Information, which appears on page 50, and Note 5, Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements, which appears on pages 60-62 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 which can be found by reference to Exhibit 13 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. McDonald, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. McDonald and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. McDonald and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. As previously reported, the Company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed, several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. The Company resolved several of these matters prior to the most recent quarter. During the most recent quarter, authorities in France issued a final decision for its investigation into laundry detergents, which resulted in a monetary penalty. As a result, the Company adjusted its previously established accrual for this matter. The remaining matters include investigations by national authorities in Belgium, France, Germany and Greece. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Competition and antitrust violations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. No non-monetary sanctions are being sought in these matters. For certain of the remaining matters listed above, we have established accruals for potential fines and we do not expect any significant incremental fines or costs in excess of amounts accrued for these matters. For other remaining matters, we cannot reasonably estimate any fines to which the Company may be subject as a result of the investigations. Please refer to the Company's Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company's European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company's local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. The Company's European affiliate 26 (s) could be levied fines in excess of $100 thousand for this accident. Item 1A. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, the Annual Report to Shareholders, other quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures and risks inherent in global manufacturing which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. In addition, we are subject to risks inherent in global manufacturing, such as environmental events, labor disputes, disruption in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing 27 regions. Growth rates in these regions may be impacted by the enactment of laws or governmental actions aimed at controlling prices. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers, or we are unable to maintain trademark protection. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. Our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in total, may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Moreover, as a U.S. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, retail trade consolidation could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across 28 broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. We could also be negatively impacted by an economic crisis in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness or a default by local governments. Such events could negatively impact our overall liquidity, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. A failure of a key information technology system, process, site or service provider could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including email and internet sites, as well as hardware, software and other applications, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third-parties or their vendors, to conduct our business. The various uses of these systems and services include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and research information, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, sharing confidential information, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security, and other processes necessary to manage our business. If the systems or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

These two segments transitioned from consumer-oriented to product-oriented segment breakouts. As a result, female blades and razors transitioned from Beauty to Grooming, while Old Spice and Gillette male personal care products moved from Grooming to Beauty. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. In addition, the Company changed how it presents noncontrolling interests in its consolidated financial statements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our Consolidated Statements of Earnings have been changed to present separately the net expense for earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. As previously disclosed, this net expense was not historically presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings due to immateriality, but was reflected within other non-operating income/(expense). To provide additional transparency related to noncontrolling interests, the historical Consolidated Statements of Earnings have been revised to conform to the new presentation, with a corresponding change to the ""net earnings"" line item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This change does not impact our historically reported net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble or the historical basic or diluted net earnings per share balances, nor does it impact total operating cash flows. However, it does impact certain amounts within those statements, which is further detailed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In this Form 8-K, the Company is providing a revised Management's Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, to revise the segment disclosures for those periods to conform to its new organization structure and to present separately the net expense for earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. The revised MD&A and consolidated financial statements otherwise continue to speak as the date of the filing of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 (the “2011 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and have not been updated for events or developments that occurred subsequent to such filing.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the Company changed its segment reporting structure and presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This Form 8-K provides pro forma historical Consolidated Statements of Earnings and segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011, as well as for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011. This information in no way revises or restates the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Shareholder’s Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. Presentation of the Snacks Business as Discontinued Operations Effective during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, we reported the Snacks business as discontinued operations due to the agreement that was announced in February 2012 to divest the Snacks business to The Kellogg Company. Therefore, Snacks sales and earnings are no longer included in the results of the continuing operations of the Company. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the current fiscal year, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. Additionally, as a result of this change the Pet Care business is now included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment effective in the January – March 2012 quarter. Fiscal Year 2012 Changes to Global Business Unit (GBU) Structure Effective during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to our organization structure within the Beauty & Grooming GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of the Beauty reportable segment and Grooming reportable segment. These two segments transitioned from consumer-oriented to product-oriented segment breakouts. As a result, female blades and razors transitioned from the Beauty reporting segment to the Grooming reporting segment, while male personal care products such as Old Spice and Gillette, moved from the Grooming reporting segment to the Beauty reporting segment. Presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings Effective during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we elected to revise our Consolidated Statements of Earnings to present separately the expense for net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. As previously disclosed, this expense has not historically been presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings due to immateriality, but has been reflected within other non-operating income/(expense). The historical Consolidated Statements of Earnings have been revised to conform to the new presentation. This document provides pro forma historical segment and consolidated earnings information reflecting these changes for the three months ended September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011, as well as for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011.

This information in no way revises or restates the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. Fiscal Year 2014 Changes to Global Business Unit (""GBU"") Structure Effective July 1, 2013, the Company implemented a number of changes to our GBU structure, which resulted in changes to our reportable segments. We organized our GBUs into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Beauty, 2) Health and Grooming, 3) Fabric and Home Care, and 4) Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying these sectors will be aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric Care and Home Care, and 5) Baby, Feminine and Family Care. As a result, Feminine Care transitioned from Health Care to Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Additionally, Pet Care transitioned from Fabric Care and Home Care to Health Care. The above changes will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2014, starting with the Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2013.

Lafley, exercised stock options for 92,896 shares of P&G common stock. A portion of the shares were sold to cover the option cost and tax liability for the exercise, and the remaining shares were added to Mr. Lafley’s current holdings, which now total 779,619 shares. These options, which were granted to Mr. Lafley during his prior tenure as CEO in 2004, were due to expire later this year. As part of his financial planning, Mr. Lafley exercised these options in order to ensure that they would not expire, given that he is subject to limited trading windows under the Company’s trading policy. Mr. Lafley will have a sale of approximately 90,000 shares later this month to cover the tax obligations resulting from the settlement of a Restricted Stock Unit grant and an annual distribution of deferred compensation, each awarded during his prior tenure as CEO. Mr. Lafley has additional options that will expire in February 2015, and he will look at opportunities to exercise those options in the coming months, prior to expiration. Each of these transactions will be reported on Form 4s, in compliance with SEC rules. Additional detail regarding Mr. Lafley’s holdings, including his outstanding stock option grants, Restricted Stock Units, and deferred compensation, are provided in the Company’s 2013 Proxy Statement.",352

Additionally, as discussed below, the Company changed its management accounting during the final quarter of fiscal 2014 for unconsolidated investees, which impacted its segment reporting. This Form 8-K provides revised historical segment earnings and Consolidated Statements of Earnings information for the three months ended March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012 and September 30, 2012, as well as for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 reflecting the above changes. This information in no way revises or restates the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholder’s Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. In April 2014, the Company announced its intent to exit the pet care business. As part of the exit plan, the Company announced an agreement to sell its pet care operations in North America, Latin America, and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 billion in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Mars will acquire our branded pet care products, our manufacturing facilities in the United States and the majority of the employees working in the pet care business. The agreement includes an option for Mars to acquire the pet care business in several additional countries. The Company expects to complete the transaction in the first half of fiscal 2015, pending the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. The European Union countries are not included in the agreement with Mars. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its pet care business in these markets. The pet care business had historically been part of the Company’s Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pet care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, will be excluded from both continuing operations and segment results. Additionally, the pet care balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2014 will be presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the final quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our management accounting for unconsolidated investees. Previously, certain unconsolidated investees that are managed as integral parts of our businesses for management reporting purposes were reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to the equity method of accounting under U.S. GAAP were included in Corporate. Pursuant to this change, segment results will no longer include full recognition of the individual income statement line items of unconsolidated investees, and resulting eliminations of such amounts will no longer be included in the corporate reportable segment. The change will not impact the net earnings of the segments or total Company. The above changes are being reflected in the consolidated financial statements and segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2014, starting with the Form 10-K that will be issued for the twelve months ending June 30, 2014. Reporting changes for both of the above items will be reflected for all historical periods presented. In advance of the Form 10-K filing, this document provides revised sales and earnings information for the affected segments and Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012 and September 30, 2012, as well as for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.

Supplemental Core Earnings per Share Information Core earnings per share is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes charges in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, charges in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela, and charges in fiscal year 2014 related to pending European legal matters. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

(""Coty"") and Green Acquisition Sub Inc. (""Coty Sub""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coty, announced the signing of a definitive agreement (the ""Transaction Agreement"") to merge 43 of the Company's beauty brands (""RMT Brands"") with Coty Sub in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The transaction includes the Company's global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. Although a final decision has not been made on the form of deal, the Company expects to do a split-off or spin-off transaction. The Company's current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which Company shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange Company shares for shares of Coty. If executed as a split-merge, the Company would establish a separate entity to hold the RMT Brands, which would be transferred to electing P&G shareholders in a tax-efficient transaction with a simultaneous merger of the new entity with Coty. Company shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their Company shares. The Company expects to finalize the details of the transaction in the coming months and to close the transaction in the second half of calendar year 2016, pending regulatory approvals. The transaction is based on a proposal by Coty valuing the P&G Beauty Business at approximately $12.5 billion at the time the proposal was made. Based on Coty's current stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is approximately $15 billion. The value is comprised of approximately 411 million shares, or 52% of the fully diluted equity of the newly combined company, valued at $13.3 billion and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by the entity holding RMT Brands. The assumed debt is expected to vary between $3.9 billion and $1.9 billion, subject to other contractual valuation adjustments, within a $22.06 to $27.06 per share collar based on the trading price of Coty's stock prior to the close of the transaction. The final value of the transaction will be known at closing based on Coty's stock price, Coty's outstanding shares and equity grants, and the amount of assumed debt. JAB Cosmetics B.V. is the owner of all of the outstanding shares of Coty's Class B common stock. In order to facilitate the transaction, JAB has agreed to convert all such shares into Class A common stock, subject to the completion of the transaction. The brands included in the transaction are Wella Professionals (and its sub-brands), Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice & Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa, Miss Clairol, L'image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, bruno banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Max Factor and Covergirl. Transfer of certain fragrance brand licenses in the transaction are subject to licensor consent. In the Transaction Agreement, the Company and Coty have agreed to certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, but not limited to, certain representations as to the financial statements, contracts, liabilities, and other attributes of the respective businesses, certain business conduct restrictions, certain covenants requiring efforts to complete the transaction and certain limited covenants of the Company not to compete and not to solicit employees following the closing of the transactions.

Exhibit 1: Selected Revised Financial Information and Non-GAAP Measures The following tables provide selected non-GAAP financial information revised for the impact of accounting for the affected Beauty businesses as discontinued operations. In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, definitions of the non-GAAP measures presented with the selected revised financial information are provided below and the reconciliation to the most closely related revised GAAP measure are provided within the following tables. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent revised GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: • charge in 2015 related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, • charges for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, • charges for balance sheet impacts from the devaluation of the foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela prior to deconsolidation, and • charges for certain European legal matters. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe that these Core measures provide an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provide a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Core EPS and Currency-neutral Core EPS: Core EPS is a measure of the Company's revised diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. We believe the Currency-neutral Core EPS measure provides a more comparable view of year-on-year earnings per share growth. The tables below provide a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS and of Core EPS to Currency-neutral Core EPS. Core Operating Profit Margin: This is a measure of the Company's revised operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Core Gross Margin: This is a measure of the Company's revised gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Core Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales: This is a measure of the Company's revised SG&A as a percentage of sales adjusted for items as indicated. Core Tax Rate: This is a measure of the Company's revised tax rate on continuing operations adjusted for items as indicated.

This informational Form 8-K provides revised historical Consolidated earnings information, along with selected financial information tables, for the three months ended June 30, March 31, December 31 and September 30 for the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017, as well as for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, reflecting the changes as described below. This informational Form 8-K in no way revises or restates the previously filed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. Fiscal Year 2018 and 2017 Changes Topic 715 requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net defined benefit costs on the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement. Other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented outside of income from operations. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-07 retrospectively. As such, prior periods’ results have been revised to report the other components of net benefit costs, previously reported in Cost of products sold and Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A), within Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The other components of net benefit costs for the periods presented are a net credit/income. As a result, the movement of these components increases Cost of products sold and SG&A, with an offsetting benefit in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The above changes will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter (July - September period) of fiscal year 2018-2019, starting with the Form 10-Q that will be issued for the three-month period ending September 30, 2018.

Exhibit 1: Selected Revised Financial Information and Non-GAAP Measures The following tables provide selected non-GAAP financial information revised for the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, ""Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost"" (""Retirement Benefits Accounting Change""). In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, definitions of the non-GAAP measures presented with the selected revised financial information are provided below and the reconciliation to the most closely related revised GAAP measure are provided within the following tables. The Core earnings from continuing operations measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act: In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""U.S. Tax Act""). This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018. The adjustment to Core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Early debt extinguishment charges : In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million and $345 million, respectively, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings from continuing operations measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core gross margin : Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of net sales : Core SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS : Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. These measures are also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Core Tax Rate: This is a measure of the Company's revised tax rate on continuing operations adjusted for items as indicated.

Topic 715 requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net defined benefit costs on the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement. Other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented outside of income from operations. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-07 retrospectively. As such, prior periods’ results have been revised to report the other components of net benefit costs, previously reported in Cost of products sold and Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A), within Other non-operating income/(expense), net. In addition, as disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230)” effective July 1, 2018. Topic 230 requires the Statement of Cash Flows to present changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, the relevant accounting guidance did not require the Statement of Cash Flows to include changes in restricted cash. We adopted this change retrospectively. We currently have no significant restricted cash balances. Historically, we had restricted cash balances and changes related to divestiture activity. Such balances were presented as Current assets held for sale on the balance sheets, with changes presented as investing activities on the statements of cash flow. Under Topic 230, such balances are included in the beginning and ending balances of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the statement of cash flows for all periods presented. In this Form 8-K, the Company is providing revised Selected Financial Data, a revised Management's Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and revised Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to revise the disclosures for those periods to reflect the accounting changes described above. The revised Selected Financial Data, MD&A and Consolidated Financial Statements otherwise continue to speak as of the date of the filing of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “2018 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and have not been updated for events or developments that occurred subsequent to such filing.

ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On February 20, 2020, Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of The Procter & Gamble Company (“The Company”), provided remarks at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (“CAGNY”) 2020 Conference, including the following comments: “We face the demand and supply challenges associated with the coronavirus outbreak. China is our second largest market—sales and profit. Store traffic is down considerably, with many stores closed or operating with reduced hours. Some of the demand has shifted online but supply of delivery operators and labor is limited. There are also impacts outside of China: travel retail, a significant reduction in department store traffic in many Asian metro areas, and global supply. We access 387 suppliers in China that ship to us globally more than 9,000 different materials, impacting approximately 17,600 different finished product items. Each of these suppliers faces their own challenges in resuming operations. The operating challenges change with the hour, and of course the path of the virus is unknown, making it very difficult to provide precise estimates of impact. Results for the January to March quarter in China and for the total Company will be materially impacted on both the top and bottom line by these dynamics. We continue to believe, based on what we know today, that our fiscal year top and bottom line guidance ranges—and I emphasize ranges—remain the right ones. We will continue to monitor the situation and obviously update you if and when a different reality becomes apparent.” The Company is furnishing this 8-K pursuant to Item 7.01, “Regulation FD Disclosure.” Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this current report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. Risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject include, without limitation: (1) the ability to successfully manage global financial risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility; (2) the ability to successfully manage local, regional or global economic volatility, including, for example, reduced market growth rates and other business disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak, and to generate sufficient income and cash flow to allow the Company to affect the expected share repurchases and dividend payments; (3) the ability to manage disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating; (4) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements (including execution of supply chain optimizations and sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements) and to manage disruption of business due to factors outside of our control, such as natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or epidemics; (5) the ability to successfully manage cost fluctuations and pressures, including prices of commodities and raw materials, and costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare; (6) the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation, obtain necessary intellectual property protections and successfully respond to changing consumer habits and technological advances attained by, and patents granted to, competitors; (7) the ability to compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing sales channels, including by successfully responding to competitive factors such as prices, promotional incentives and trade terms for products; (8) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (9) the ability to protect our reputation and brand equity by successfully managing real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy or similar matters that may arise; (10) the ability to successfully manage the financial, legal, reputational and operational risk associated with third-party relationships, such as our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and external business partners; (11) the ability to rely on and maintain key company and third party information technology systems, networks and services, and maintain the security and functionality of such systems, networks and services and the data contained therein; (12) the ability to successfully manage uncertainties related to changing political conditions (including the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union) and potential implications such as exchange rate fluctuations and market contraction; (13) the ability to successfully manage regulatory and legal requirements and matters (including, without limitation, those laws and regulations involving product liability, product and packaging composition, intellectual property, antitrust, data protection, tax, environmental, and accounting and financial reporting) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (14) the ability to manage changes in applicable tax laws and regulations including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions; (15) the ability to successfully manage our ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities, in each case to achieve the Company’s overall business strategy and financial objectives, without impacting the delivery of base business objectives; and (16) the ability to successfully achieve productivity improvements and cost savings and manage ongoing organizational changes, while successfully identifying, developing and retaining key employees, including in key growth markets where the availability of skilled or experienced employees may be limited.

The Procter & Gamble Company (the “Company”) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to supplement the risk factors described in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The following risk factor disclosure should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. We must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns. Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These impacts include, but are not limited to: Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity; if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may adversely impact our results; Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve costs targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability; Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.",762

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN On April 11, 2023, the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company (the “Company”) appointed Sheila Bonini, Senior Vice President – Private Sector Engagement for World Wildlife Fund, Inc., and Robert Portman, former United States Senator, as Directors of the Company, effective April 11, 2023. Ms. Bonini will serve on the Governance & Public Responsibility and Innovation & Technology Committees. Mr. Portman will serve on the Audit and Governance & Public Responsibility Committees. The Board has determined that Ms. Bonini and Mr. Portman are each independent under the NYSE listing standards and the Company’s Independence Guidelines. Ms. Bonini and Mr. Portman will each receive the same compensation as the other non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Company’s Director compensation program is described in the Company’s definitive proxy statement dated August 26, 2022. In connection with the appointment of Ms. Bonini, the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the Company’s continued financial contributions to the World Wildlife Fund, Inc. (“WWF-US”) under the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. By virtue of her role at WWF-US, prior to her appointment as a Director, Ms. Bonini was involved in the discussion of the Company’s contributions to and partnership with WWF-US in support of various sustainability efforts and programs, although Ms. Bonini did not receive special benefits from the Company’s contributions. The Company has worked with and contributed to WWF-US since 2013. In its current fiscal year, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $550,000 to WWF-US under several partnership agreements. Upon her appointment as a Director of the Company, Ms. Bonini is no longer involved in and no longer has direct or indirect responsibility for WWF-US’s relationship with the Company, and she will not be involved in the negotiation of any future partnership terms or payments for as long as she remains a Director. In approving the Company’s continued contributions and partnership, the Board considered the Company’s long-standing support of WWF-US, the significant value to the Company of external partnerships with organizations focused on sustainability efforts, and the fact that, going forward, Ms. Bonini would not be involved in the Company’s financial relationship with WWF-US. Ultimately, the Board concluded that the partnership contributions were not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company as a whole. The Company is filing the information under this item pursuant to Item 5.02(d), “Election of Directors.” ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE The Company issued a news release on April 11, 2023, announcing the appointments of Ms. Bonini and Mr. Portman.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure The Procter & Gamble Company (the “Company”) announced today a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. The Company estimates the large majority of these charges will be noncash. Although the timing of the completion of this restructuring program has yet to be determined, the Company currently anticipates that these restructuring charges will be recognized in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and 2025, with initial charges recognized in the quarter ending December 31, 2023. Combining the restructuring program with an impairment charge described further below, the Company anticipates total charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion after tax over the periods described. The Company estimates a large majority of these charges will be noncash. These charges will be reported as non-core charges. The Company is furnishing the information under this item pursuant to Item 7.01, “Regulation FD Disclosure.” Item 2.06 Material Impairments In connection with the restructuring program discussed above, on December 1, 2023, the Company concluded it will record an approximately $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) noncash impairment charge in the quarter ending December 31, 2023, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arises from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusts the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. Underlying performance of the Gillette business remains strong. However, future adverse changes in the business or macroeconomic environment may trigger a further impairment charge. The Company is filing the information under this item pursuant to Item 2.06, “Material Impairments.” Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this current report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

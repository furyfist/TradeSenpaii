# TradeSenpai

**AI-Powered Stock Research Platform**

**Version 3.0 — February 2026**

📄 **[API Reference](Api_reference.md)** — Full endpoint documentation (V4 · March 2026)

---

## Overview

TradeSenpai is an AI-powered stock research platform designed to give retail investors access to the same quality of signal analysis that institutional research desks use daily. The platform combines quantitative technical analysis, SEC regulatory filing sentiment, transformer-based machine learning models, and a multi-agent AI hypothesis engine to deliver structured, explainable research — not arbitrary price predictions.

The core premise is straightforward: retail investors are at an information disadvantage not because markets are rigged, but because the tools and workflows used by institutional analysts — reading 10-Ks for language shifts, computing technical regimes, synthesizing historical analogies — are simply inaccessible. TradeSenpai automates that workflow and surfaces it through a clean, terminal-aesthetic research interface.

> **This is not a trading system.** TradeSenpai is an educational simulation and research augmentation tool. Model accuracy is 51.9–53.5% on next-day direction classification — honest and statistically meaningful given market noise, not a failure. The academic ceiling for short-term direction prediction is approximately 55–56%. All outputs include explicit uncertainty disclosures.

## What's New in Version 3

Version 3 represents the largest architectural leap in the project's history. Two major systems were introduced on top of the V2 prediction and explanation foundation:

### 1. Hypothesis Engine (6-Agent AI Research Pipeline)

A user submits a natural language market hypothesis — for example, *"Apple will drop 10% in the next 60 days"* — and six independent AI agents research, validate, stress-test, and synthesize it into a structured research brief.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Agent 1 — Parser** | Extracts ticker, target price, timeframe, implied return, and hypothesis type from free text. Flags statistically unrealistic moves using a z-score against 5-year rolling return distributions. |
| **Agent 2 — Market Context** | Pulls the current live technical state for the identified ticker: RSI, MA regime, momentum, volatility, Bollinger band position, sentiment score. |
| **Agent 3 — Historical Evidence** | Computes base rates from the full historical dataset: what percentage of comparable windows produced the implied move? Surfaces the top 3 most similar historical setups via cosine similarity. |
| **Agent 4 — Bear Case** | Uses Tavily web search + Llama 3.3-70B to retrieve and format current sourced evidence for the downside scenario. |
| **Agent 5 — Bull Case** | Same architecture as Agent 4, for the upside scenario. |
| **Agent 6 — Synthesizer** | Receives all five agent outputs and produces a structured research brief: feasibility score (0–100), verdict, key risks, key catalysts, and a quantitative summary. |

The feasibility score is interpretable and composable: 40 points from the historical base rate for the implied move, 30 points from technical regime alignment, 30 points from the realism check (penalizing statistically implausible hypotheses).

### 2. Telegram Alert System

A scheduled, multi-subscriber alert delivery system built on APScheduler and the Telegram Bot API:

- **Morning Brief** (9:30 AM ET) — Directional predictions, confidence tiers, and sentiment readings for all six tickers
- **Evening Brief** (4:15 PM ET) — Actual vs. predicted outcomes for the day with accuracy tracking
- **Weekly Digest** (Sunday 6:00 PM ET) — Per-ticker accuracy statistics from the live prediction history database
- **Signal Alerts** (every 2 hours) — Direction flip, sentiment spike, and litigation flag change notifications

Subscriber management is handled through a `/subscribe` endpoint with optional self-registration via Telegram chat ID (immediate approval) or admin-controlled approval for username-only registrations.

## Model Performance

All models use TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation (no lookahead leakage). Accuracy reflects real-world directional prediction difficulty.

| Ticker | Company | CV Accuracy | Sector |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| KO | Coca-Cola | **52.29%** ± 0.67% | Consumer Staples |
| JNJ | Johnson & Johnson | **51.97%** ± 1.10% | Healthcare |
| PG | Procter & Gamble | **51.92%** ± 1.31% | Consumer Staples |
| WMT | Walmart | **53.33%** ± 1.47% | Retail |
| AAPL | Apple | **52.40%** ± 0.76% | Technology |
| GOOGL | Alphabet | **53.48%** ± 1.22% | Technology |

All models exceed the majority-class baseline (50%). The range of 51.9–53.5% is consistent with published academic results on short-term equity direction classification. The ceiling for this task is approximately 55–56%.

## Known Limitations

- **~52% accuracy ceiling** — Inherent to short-term direction prediction on public data. This is the honest bound, not a failure of the implementation.
- **Forward-filled sentiment** — LM scores are forward-filled between SEC filing dates. Intra-quarter sentiment is static.
- **No earnings calendar integration** — Earnings event flags are not yet included in the feature set.
- **No macro features** — VIX, SPX regime, interest rate data are not currently used.
- **yfinance dependency** — No SLA guarantees; occasional data gaps require handling.
- **Local deployment only** — V3 runs on localhost. Cloud deployment (Railway, Render) is architecturally straightforward but not yet implemented.
- **Desktop-focused UI** — Not optimized for mobile viewports.

## Technical Debt

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Zero test coverage | High | No unit or integration tests exist |
| Inline CSS in all React components | Medium | Works but verbose; migration to CSS modules planned |
| No earnings calendar feature | High | Known gap since V2; significant signal value |
| No input sanitization on hypothesis text | Medium | Currently trusts user input |
| Inline CSS → CSS modules | Low | Cosmetic; no functional impact |
| `bot_listener.py` daemon thread | Low | Not gracefully stoppable on server shutdown |

## Design Principles

These principles emerged empirically across three versions and are now explicit constraints on the project:

1. **Domain-specific beats general-purpose.** The Loughran-McDonald dictionary outperformed FinBERT on SEC filings. A curated 2,700-word lexicon built for financial regulatory documents outperformed a 110M-parameter neural network. Fit to domain matters more than parameter count.

2. **Honest accuracy is more valuable than inflated accuracy.** 52% CV accuracy is reported and displayed openly. Chasing a higher number would require either overfitting or data leakage — both of which would make the tool less trustworthy, not more useful.

3. **Explanation value exceeds prediction value.** Users benefit more from understanding *why* a signal exists than from a bare UP/DOWN. The explanation layer, historical analogies, and hypothesis engine all serve this principle.

4. **Silent failures are the hardest bugs.** Every significant bug in this project produced no error — the hardcoded ticker, the naming collision, the wrong broadcast function. Logging and assertions at key pipeline stages are the primary defense.

5. **Per-ticker models over shared models.** A single model trained across all tickers must learn six different volatility regimes simultaneously. Separate models are simpler, more accurate, and independently debuggable.

---

## Roadmap (V4)

- Cloud deployment (Railway / Render)
- Earnings calendar feature integration
- Prediction history visualization in the dashboard
- Backtesting view for hypothesis feasibility scores
- Additional tickers (expansion beyond current six)
- Test suite (pytest for backend, vitest for frontend)
